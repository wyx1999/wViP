Cancer is a disease of uncontrollably reproducing cells. It is governed by 
biochemical pathways that have escaped the regulatory bounds of normal 
homeostatic balance. This balance is maintained through precise spatiotemporal 
regulation of these pathways. The formation of biomolecular condensates via 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has recently emerged as a widespread 
mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal coordination of biological activities in 
cells. Biomolecular condensates are widely observed to directly regulate key 
cellular processes involved in cancer cell pathology, and the dysregulation of 
LLPS is increasingly implicated as a previously hidden driver of oncogenic 
activity. In this Perspective, we discuss how LLPS shapes the biochemical 
landscape of cancer cells.

In eukaryotic cells, protein and RNA factors involved in genome activities like 
transcription, RNA processing, DNA replication, and repair accumulate in 
self-organizing membraneless chromatin subcompartments. These structures 
contribute to efficiently conduct chromatin-mediated reactions and to establish 
specific cellular programs. However, the underlying mechanisms for their 
formation are only partly understood. Recent studies invoke liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) of proteins and RNAs in the establishment of chromatin 
activity patterns. At the same time, the folding of chromatin in the nucleus can 
drive genome partitioning into spatially distinct domains. Here, the interplay 
between chromatin organization, chromatin binding, and LLPS is discussed by 
comparing and contrasting three prototypical chromatin subcompartments: the 
nucleolus, clusters of active RNA polymerase II, and pericentric heterochromatin 
domains. It is discussed how the different ways of chromatin 
compartmentalization are linked to transcription regulation, the targeting of 
soluble factors to certain parts of the genome, and to disease-causing genetic 
aberrations.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a crucial phenomenon for the formation 
of functional membraneless organelles. However, LLPS is also responsible for 
protein aggregation in various neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, 
several reports, including ours, have shown that α-synuclein (α-Syn) undergoes 
LLPS and a subsequent liquid-to-solid phase transition, which leads to amyloid 
fibril formation. However, how the environmental (and experimental) parameters 
modulate the α-Syn LLPS remains elusive. Here, we show that in vitro α-Syn LLPS 
is strongly dependent on the presence of salts, which allows charge 
neutralization at both terminal segments of protein and therefore promotes 
hydrophobic interactions supportive for LLPS. Using various purification methods 
and experimental conditions, we showed, depending upon conditions, α-Syn 
undergoes either spontaneous (instantaneous) or delayed LLPS. Furthermore, we 
delineate that the kinetics of liquid droplet formation (i.e., the critical 
concentration and critical time) is relative and can be modulated by the 
salt/counterion concentration, pH, presence of surface, PD-associated 
multivalent cations, and N-terminal acetylation, which are all known to regulate 
α-Syn aggregation in vitro. Together, our observations suggest that α-Syn LLPS 
and subsequent liquid-to-solid phase transition could be pathological, which can 
be triggered only under disease-associated conditions (high critical 
concentration and/or conditions promoting α-Syn self-assembly). This study will 
significantly improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of α-Syn 
LLPS and the liquid-to-solid transition.

Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau plays a major role in 
Alzheimer's disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders. An exciting 
recent development is the finding that, akin to some other proteins associated 
with neurodegenerative disease, tau has a high propensity to condensate via the 
mechanism of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Here, we discuss the 
evidence for tau LLPS in vitro, the molecular mechanisms of this reaction, and 
the role of post-translational modifications and pathogenic mutations in tau 
phase separation. We also discuss recent studies on tau LLPS in cells and the 
insights these studies provide regarding the link between LLPS and 
neurodegeneration in tauopathies.

In higher plants, chloroplasts are vital organelles possessing highly complex 
compartmentalization. As most chloroplast-located proteins are encoded in the 
nucleus and synthesized in the cytosol, the correct sorting of these proteins to 
appropriate compartments is critical for the proper functions of chloroplasts as 
well as plant survival. Nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are imported into 
stroma and further sorted to distinct compartments via different pathways. The 
proteins predicted to be sorted to the thylakoid lumen by the chloroplast twin 
arginine transport (cpTAT) pathway are shown to be facilitated by STT1/2 driven 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Liquid-liquid phase separation is a novel 
mechanism to facilitate the formation of membrane-less sub-cellular compartments 
and accelerate biochemical reactions temporally and spatially. In this review, 
we introduce the sorting mechanisms within chloroplasts, and briefly summarize 
the properties and significance of LLPS, with an emphasis on the novel function 
of LLPS in the sorting of cpTAT substrate proteins. We conclude with 
perspectives for the future research on chloroplast protein sorting and 
targeting mechanisms.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a type of phase transition that is 
important in organisms, is a unique means of forming biomolecular condensates. 
LLPS plays a significant role in transcription, genome organisation, immune 
response and cell signaling, and its dysregulation may cause neurodegenerative 
diseases and cancers. Exploring the regulatory mechanism of LLPS contributes to 
the understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of abnormal phase transition and 
enables potential therapeutic targets to be proposed. Many factors have been 
found to regulate LLPS, of which post-translational modification (PTM) is among 
the most important. PTMs can change the structure, charge, hydrophobicity and 
other properties of the proteins involved in phase separation and thereby affect 
the phase transition behaviour. In this review, we discuss LLPS and the 
regulatory effects of PTMs, RNA and molecular chaperones in a phase separation 
system. We introduce several common PTMs (including phosphorylation, arginine 
methylation, arginine citrullination, acetylation, ubiquitination and 
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation), highlight recent advances regarding their roles in LLPS 
and describe the regulatory mechanisms behind these features. This review 
provides a detailed overview of the field that will help further the 
understanding of and interventions in LLPS.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a novel principle for explaining the 
precise spatial and temporal regulation in living cells. LLPS compartmentalizes 
proteins and nucleic acids into micron-scale, liquid-like, membraneless bodies 
with specific functions, which were recently termed biomolecular condensates. 
Biomolecular condensates are executors underlying the intracellular 
spatiotemporal coordination of various biological activities, including 
chromatin organization, genomic stability, DNA damage response and repair, 
transcription, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of these cellular 
processes is a key event in the initiation and/or evolution of cancer, and 
emerging evidence has linked the formation and regulation of LLPS to malignant 
transformations in tumor biology. In this review, we comprehensively summarize 
the detailed mechanisms of biomolecular condensate formation and biophysical 
function and review the recent major advances toward elucidating the multiple 
mechanisms involved in cancer cell pathology driven by aberrant LLPS. In 
addition, we discuss the therapeutic perspectives of LLPS in cancer research and 
the most recently developed drug candidates targeting LLPS modulation that can 
be used to combat tumorigenesis.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a biochemical process in cells that can 
drive proteins, RNA, and other molecules to concentrate into droplets. These 
droplets do not have a lipid membrane but rather exist as distinct organelles 
relative to the surrounding environment, and act as biochemical reaction 
chambers. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of 
LLPS, especially in the neurodegenerative disease, cancer, and virology fields, 
but little is known about LLPS in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this review, 
we discuss the current understanding of the mechanism and biological functions 
of LLPS, particularly its roles in regulating CVD.

As sessile organisms, plants are highly sensitive to environmental stresses. In 
response to stresses, globally repressed translation initiation leads to stress 
granule (SG) formation. Protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
contributes to SG formation, but a direct link between protein LLPS and stress 
resistance has not yet been found in plants. Here, we report that two 
RNA-binding proteins, RBGD2 and RBGD4, function redundantly to improve heat 
resistance in Arabidopsis. RBGD2 and RBGD4 undergo LLPS in vitro and condense 
into heat-induced SGs in vivo via tyrosine residue array (TRA). Importantly, 
disrupting LLPS by mutating TRA abolishes RBGD2/4 condensation in SGs and 
impairs their protective function against heat stress (HS). Further study found 
that upon HS, the RBGD2/4 interaction network expands with additional SG 
proteins and heat-responsive mRNA. Our work shows a mechanistic basis that 
underlies protein LLPS in HS response in plants and suggests manipulation of 
protein LLPS as a general strategy to improve plant stress resistance.

TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein that forms ribonucleoprotein condensates via 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and regulates gene expression through 
specific RNA interactions. Loss of TDP-43 protein homeostasis and dysfunction 
are tied to neurodegenerative disorders, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Alterations of TDP-43 LLPS properties may be 
linked to protein aggregation. However, the mechanisms regulating TDP-43 LLPS 
are ill-defined, particularly how TDP-43 association with specific RNA targets 
regulates TDP-43 condensation remains unclear. We show that RNA binding strongly 
promotes TDP-43 LLPS through sequence-specific interactions. RNA-driven 
condensation increases with the number of adjacent TDP-43-binding sites and is 
also mediated by multivalent interactions involving the amino and 
carboxy-terminal TDP-43 domains. The physiological relevance of RNA-driven 
TDP-43 condensation is supported by similar observations in mammalian cellular 
lysate. Importantly, we find that TDP-43-RNA association maintains liquid-like 
properties of the condensates, which are disrupted in the presence of ALS-linked 
TDP-43 mutations. Altogether, RNA binding plays a central role in modulating 
TDP-43 condensation while maintaining protein solubility, and defects in this 
RNA-mediated activity may underpin TDP-43-associated pathogenesis.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of RNA-binding proteins mediates the formation of 
numerous membraneless organelles with essential cellular function. However, 
aberrant phase transition of these proteins leads to the formation of insoluble 
protein aggregates, which are pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative 
diseases including ALS and FTD. TDP-43 and FUS are two such RNA-binding proteins 
that mislocalize and aggregate in patients of ALS and FTD. They have similar 
domain structures that provide multivalent interactions driving their phase 
separation in vitro and in the cellular environment. In this article, we review 
the factors that mediate and regulate phase separation of TDP-43 and FUS. We 
also review evidences that connect the phase separation property of TDP-43 and 
FUS to their functional roles in cells. Aberrant phase transition of TDP-43 and 
FUS leads to protein aggregation and disrupts their regular cell function. 
Therefore, restoration of functional protein phase of TDP-43 and FUS could be 
beneficial for neuronal cells. We discuss possible mechanisms for TDP-43 and FUS 
aberrant phase transition and aggregation while reviewing the methods that are 
currently being explored as potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate 
aberrant phase transition and aggregation of TDP-43 and FUS.

Biomineralization is a typical interdisciplinary subject attracting biologists, 
chemists, and geologists to figure out its potential mechanism. A mounting 
number of studies have revealed that the classical nucleation theory is not 
suitable for all nucleation process of biominerals, and phase-separated 
structures such as polymer-induced liquid precursors (PILPs) play essential 
roles in the non-classical nucleation processes. These structures are able to 
play diverse roles biologically or pathologically, and could also give inspiring 
clues to bionic applications. However, a lot of confusion and dispute occurred 
due to the intricacy and interdisciplinary nature of liquid precursors. 
Researchers in different fields may have different opinions because the 
terminology and current state of understanding is not common knowledge. As a 
result, our team reviewed the most recent articles focusing on the nucleation 
processes of various biominerals to clarify the state-of-the-art understanding 
of some essential concepts and guide the newcomers to enter this intricate but 
charming field.

Immune signalling pathways convert pathogenic stimuli into cytosolic events that 
lead to the resolution of infection. Upon ligand engagement, immune receptors 
together with their downstream adaptors and effectors undergo substantial 
conformational changes and spatial reorganization. During this process, 
nanometre-to-micrometre-sized signalling clusters have been commonly observed 
that are believed to be hotspots for signal transduction. Because of their large 
size and heterogeneous composition, it remains a challenge to fully understand 
the mechanisms by which these signalling clusters form and their functional 
consequences. Recently, phase separation has emerged as a new biophysical 
principle for organizing biomolecules into large clusters with fluidic 
properties. Although the field is still in its infancy, studies of phase 
separation in immunology are expected to provide new perspectives for 
understanding immune responses. Here, we present an up-to-date view of how 
liquid-liquid phase separation drives the formation of signalling condensates 
and regulates immune signalling pathways, including those downstream of T cell 
receptor, B cell receptor and the innate immune receptors cyclic GMP-AMP 
synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and retinoic 
acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I). We conclude with a summary of the current 
challenges the field is facing and outstanding questions for future studies.

Eukaryotic cells have both membranous and membraneless organelles. While the 
formation mechanism of membranous organelles is well understood, the formation 
mechanism of membraneless organelles remains unknown. Many biomolecules in the 
cytoplasm transition from the liquid phase to the agglutinated phase are known 
as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The biomolecular agglomerates' 
physical properties enable them to function as dynamic compartments that respond 
to external pressures and stimuli. Scientists have gradually recognized the 
importance of phase separation during viral infections. LLPS provides a powerful 
new framework for understanding the viral life cycle from viral replication to 
evasion of host immune surveillance. As a result, this review focuses on the 
progress of LLPS research in viral infection and immune regulation to provide 
clues for antiviral therapeutic strategies.

The mechanism that initiates autophagosome formation on the ER in multicellular 
organisms is elusive. Here, we showed that autophagy stimuli trigger Ca2+ 
transients on the outer surface of the ER membrane, whose amplitude, frequency, 
and duration are controlled by the metazoan-specific ER transmembrane autophagy 
protein EPG-4/EI24. Persistent Ca2+ transients/oscillations on the cytosolic ER 
surface in EI24-depleted cells cause accumulation of FIP200 autophagosome 
initiation complexes on the ER. This defect is suppressed by attenuating ER Ca2+ 
transients. Multi-modal SIM analysis revealed that Ca2+ transients on the ER 
trigger the formation of dynamic and fusion-prone liquid-like FIP200 puncta. 
Starvation-induced Ca2+ transients on lysosomes also induce FIP200 puncta that 
further move to the ER. Multiple FIP200 puncta on the ER, whose association 
depends on the ER proteins VAPA/B and ATL2/3, assemble into autophagosome 
formation sites. Thus, Ca2+ transients are crucial for triggering phase 
separation of FIP200 to specify autophagosome initiation sites in metazoans.

The cancer state is thought to be maintained by genetic and epigenetic changes 
that drive a cancer-promoting gene expression program. However, recent results 
show that cellular states can be also stably maintained by the reorganization of 
cell structure leading to the formation of biological condensates via the 
process of liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we review the data showing 
cancer-specific biological condensates initiated by mutant oncoproteins, 
RNA-binding proteins, or lincRNAs that regulate oncogenic gene expression 
programs and cancer metabolism. Effective anticancer drugs may specifically 
partition into oncogenic biological condensates (OBC).

Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation Bridges Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

Zhu J, Jiang L.

There is a fundamental gap between the inherent complexity of biology and the 
simplicity that physicists and chemists often seek. In this Perspective, we 
reason that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) could be utilized to 
(partially) fill this gap and to bridge different disciplines because LLPS can 
produce condensed droplets with simplicity and complexity at the same time. 
Specifically, the droplets are often compositionally simple (made of, for 
example, proteins and polyelectrolytes) and structurally uniform (not so 
different from an oil droplet in water). Contrary to this simplicity is their 
functional complexity─the droplets can perform various physiological activities 
with subcellular precision. This spatiotemporal precision further stimulates an 
ongoing endeavor in the synthetic realm to develop regulatory strategies that 
may ultimately match or even surpass their biological counterparts. We envision 
the phase-separated droplets to open a window of simplicity for us to peek into 
the complexity of biology, and we foresee that joined forces across different 
disciplines would substantially advance our understanding of LLPS in biotic and 
abiotic contexts.

Light and temperature in plants are perceived by a common receptor, phytochrome 
B (phyB). How phyB distinguishes these signals remains elusive. Here, we report 
that phyB spontaneously undergoes phase separation to assemble liquid-like 
droplets. This capacity is driven by its C terminus through self-association, 
whereas the intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension (NTE) functions as a 
biophysical modulator of phase separation. Light exposure triggers a 
conformational change to subsequently alter phyB condensate assembly, while 
temperature sensation is directly mediated by the NTE to modulate the phase 
behavior of phyB droplets. Multiple signaling components are selectively 
incorporated into phyB droplets to form concentrated microreactors, allowing 
switch-like control of phyB signaling activity through phase transitions. 
Therefore, light and temperature cues are separately read out by phyB via 
allosteric changes and spontaneous phase separation, respectively. We provide a 
conceptual framework showing how the distinct but highly correlated physical 
signals are interpreted and sorted by one receptor.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) compartmentalizes and concentrates 
biomacromolecules into liquid-like condensates, which underlies membraneless 
organelles (MLOs) formation in eukaryotic cells. With increasing evidence of the 
LLPS concept and methods, this phenomenon as a novel principle accounts for 
explaining the precise spatial and temporal regulation of cellular functions. 
Moreover, the phenomenon that LLPS tends to concentrate proteins is often 
accompanied by several abnormal signals for human diseases. It is reported that 
multiple metabolic diseases are strongly associated with the deposition of 
insoluble proteinaceous aggregating termed amyloids. At present, recent studies 
have observed the roles of LLPS in several metabolic diseases, including type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and metabolic bone diseases 
(MBDs). This review aims to expound on the current concept and methods of LLPS 
and summarize its vital roles in T2DM, AD, and MBDs, uncover novel mechanisms of 
these metabolic diseases, and thus provide powerful potential therapeutic 
strategies and targets for ameliorating these metabolic diseases.

Aberrant aggregation of the misfolded presynaptic protein, α-Synuclein (α-Syn) 
into Lewy body (LB) and Lewy neuritis (LN) is a major pathological hallmark of 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Numerous studies have 
suggested that prefibrillar and fibrillar species of the misfolded α-Syn 
aggregates are responsible for cell death in PD pathogenesis. However, the 
precise molecular events during α-Syn aggregation, especially in the early 
stages, remain elusive. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) of α-Syn occurs in the nucleation step of α-Syn 
aggregation, which offers an alternate non-canonical aggregation pathway in the 
crowded microenvironment. The liquid-like α-Syn droplets gradually undergo an 
irreversible liquid-to-solid phase transition into amyloid-like hydrogel 
entrapping oligomers and fibrils. This new mechanism of α-Syn LLPS and gel 
formation might represent the molecular basis of cellular toxicity associated 
with PD. This review aims to demonstrate the recent development of α-Syn LLPS, 
the underlying mechanism along with the microscopic events of aberrant phase 
transition. This review further discusses how several intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors regulate the thermodynamics and kinetics of α-Syn LLPS and co-LLPS with 
other proteins, which might explain the pathophysiology of α-Syn in various 
neurodegenerative diseases.

Recent evidence has shown that the processes of liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) or liquid-liquid phase transitions (LLPTs) are a crucial and prevalent 
phenomenon that underlies the biogenesis of numerous membrane-less organelles 
(MLOs) and biomolecular condensates within the cells. Findings show that 
processes associated with LLPS play an essential role in physiology and disease. 
In this review, we discuss the physical and biomolecular factors that contribute 
to the development of LLPS, the associated functions, as well as their 
consequences for cell physiology and neurological disorders. Additionally, the 
finding of mis-regulated proteins, which have long been linked to aggregates in 
neuropathology, are also known to induce LLPS/LLPTs, prompting a lot of interest 
in understanding the connection between aberrant phase separation and disorder 
conditions. Moreover, the methods used in recent and ongoing studies in this 
field are also explored, as is the possibility that these findings will 
encourage new lines of inquiry into the molecular causes of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Synaptic plasticity is a cellular mechanism of learning and memory. The synaptic 
strength can be persistently upregulated or downregulated to update the 
information sent to the neuronal network and form a memory engram. For its 
molecular mechanism, the stability of 
α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate-type glutamate receptor 
(AMPAR), a glutamatergic ionotropic receptor, on the postsynaptic membrane has 
been studied for these two decades. Since AMPAR is not saturated on the 
postsynaptic membrane during a single event of neurotransmitter release, the 
number and nanoscale localization of AMPAR is critical for regulating the 
efficacy of synaptic transmission. The observation of AMPAR on the postsynaptic 
membrane by super-resolution microscopy revealed that AMPAR forms a nanodomain 
that is defined as a stable segregated cluster on the postsynaptic membrane to 
increase the efficacy of synaptic transmission. Postsynaptic density (PSD), an 
intracellular protein condensate underneath the postsynaptic membrane, regulates 
AMPAR dynamics via the intracellular domain of Stargazin, an auxiliary subunit 
of AMPAR. Recently, it was reported that PSD is organized by liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) to form liquid-like protein condensates. Furthermore, the 
calcium signal induced by the learning event triggers the persistent formation 
of sub-compartments of different protein groups inside protein condensates. This 
explains the formation of nanodomains via synaptic activation. The liquid-like 
properties of LLPS protein condensates are ideal for the molecular mechanism of 
synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the 
properties and regulation of synaptic plasticity, postsynaptic receptors, PSD, 
and LLPS.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has received significant attention in 
recent biological studies. It refers to a phenomenon that biomolecule exceeds 
the solubility, condensates and separates itself from solution in liquid like 
droplets formation. Our understanding of it has also changed from memebraneless 
organelles to compartmentalization, muti-functional crucibles, and reaction 
regulators. Although this phenomenon has been employed for a variety of 
biological processes, recent studies mainly focus on its physiological 
significance, and the comprehensive research of the underlying physical 
mechanism is limited. The characteristics of side chains of amino acids and the 
interaction tendency of proteins function importantly in regulating LLPS thus 
should be pay more attention on. In addition, the importance of 
post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been underestimated, despite their 
abundance and crucial functions in maintaining the electrostatic balance. In 
this review, we first introduce the driving forces and protein secondary 
structures involved in LLPS and their different physical functions in cell life 
processes. Subsequently, we summarize the existing reports on PTM regulation 
related to LLPS and analyze the underlying basic principles, hoping to find some 
common relations between LLPS and PTM. Finally, we speculate several unreported 
PTMs that may have a significant impact on phase separation basing on the 
findings.

The pathological features of PDD are represented by dopaminergic neuronal death 
and intracellular α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. The interaction of iron 
accumulation with α-syn and tau was further explored as an essential 
pathological mechanism of PDD. However, the links and mechanisms between these 
factors remain unclear. Studies have shown that the occurrence and development 
of neurodegenerative diseases such as PDD are closely related to the separation 
of abnormal phases. Substances such as proteins can form droplets through 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) under normal physiological conditions and 
even undergo further liquid-solid phase transitions to form solid aggregates 
under disease or regulatory disorders, leading to pathological phenomena. By 
analyzing the existing literature, we propose that LLPS is the crucial mechanism 
causing abnormal accumulation of α-syn, tau, and other proteins in PDD, and its 
interaction with iron metabolism disorder is the key factor driving ferroptosis 
in PDD. Therefore, we believe that LLPS can serve as one of the means to explain 
the pathological mechanism of PDD. Determining the significance of LLPS in 
neurodegenerative diseases such as PDD will stimulate interest in research into 
treatments based on interference with abnormal LLPS.

As a promising strategy, amorphous solid dispersion has been extensively 
employed in improving the oral bioavailability of insoluble drugs. Despite the 
numerous advantages, the problems associated with supersaturation stability 
limit its further application. Recently, the formation and stability of the 
liquid-liquid phase separation drug aggregate (LLPS-DA) have been found to be 
vital for supersaturation maintenance. An in-depth review of LLPS-DA was 
required to further explore the supersaturation maintenance mechanism in vivo. 
Hence, this study aimed to present a short review to introduce the LLPS-DA, 
highlight the in vivo advantages for oral administration, and discuss the 
prospects to help understand the in vivo behavior of LLPS-DA.

Heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) orchestrates the fast and vast cellular 
response to heat shock through increased expression of heat-shock proteins. 
However, how HSF1 rapidly and reversibly regulates transcriptional reprogramming 
remains poorly defined. Here by combining super-resolution imaging, in vitro 
reconstitution and high-throughput sequencing, we reveal that HSF1 forms small 
nuclear condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation at heat-shock-protein 
gene loci and enriches multiple transcription apparatuses through co-phase 
separation to promote the transcription of target genes. Furthermore, the 
phase-separation capability of HSF1 is fine-tuned through phosphorylation at 
specific sites within the regulatory domain. Last, we discovered that HSP70 
disperses HSF1 condensates to attenuate transcription following the cessation of 
heat shock and further prevents the gel-like phase transition of HSF1 under 
extended heat-shock stress. Our work reveals an inducible and reversible 
phase-separation feedback mechanism for dynamic regulation of HSF1 activity to 
drive the transcriptional response and maintain protein homeostasis during acute 
stress.

The ParABS system is supposed to be responsible for plasmid partitioning and 
chromosome segregation in bacteria. ParABS ensures a high degree of fidelity in 
inheritance by dividing the genetic material equally between daughter cells 
during cell division. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly 
of the partition complex, representing the core of the ParABS system, are still 
far from being understood. Here we demonstrate that the partition complex is 
formed via liquid-liquid phase separation. Assembly of the partition complex is 
initiated by the formation of oligomeric ParB species, which in turn are 
regulated by CTP-binding. Phase diagrams and in vivo analysis show how the 
partition complex can further be spatially regulated by parS. By investigating 
the phylogenetic variation in phase separation and its regulation by CTP, we 
find a high degree of evolutionary conservation among distantly related 
prokaryotes. These results advance the understanding of partition complex 
formation and regulation in general, by confirming and extending recently 
proposed models.

The interplay between phase separation and wetting of multicomponent mixtures is 
ubiquitous in nature and technology and recently gained significant attention 
across scientific disciplines, due to the discovery of biomolecular condensates. 
It is well understood that sessile droplets, undergoing phase separation in a 
static wetting configuration, exhibit microdroplet nucleation at their contact 
lines, forming an oil ring during later stages. However, very little is known 
about the dynamic counterpart, when phase separation occurs in a nonequilibrium 
wetting configuration, i.e., spreading droplets. Here we show that liquid-liquid 
phase separation strongly couples to the spreading motion of three-phase contact 
lines. Thus, the classical Cox-Voinov law is not applicable anymore, because 
phase separation adds an active spreading force beyond the capillary driving. 
Intriguingly, we observe that spreading starts well before any visible 
nucleation of microdroplets in the main droplet. Using high-speed ellipsometry, 
we further demonstrate that the evaporation-induced enrichment, together with 
surface forces, causes an even earlier nucleation in the wetting precursor film 
around the droplet, initiating the observed wetting transition. We expect our 
findings to improve the fundamental understanding of phase separation processes 
that involve dynamical contact lines and/or surface forces, with implications in 
a wide range of applications, from oil recovery or inkjet printing to material 
synthesis and biomolecular condensates.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biomolecules inspires the construction 
of protocells and drives the formation of cellular membraneless organelles. The 
resulting biomolecular condensates featuring dynamic assembly, disassembly, and 
phase transition play significant roles in a series of biological processes, 
including RNA metabolism, DNA damage response, signal transduction and 
neurodegenerative disease. Intensive investigations have been conducted for 
understanding and manipulating intracellular phase-separated disease-related 
proteins (e.g., FUS, tau and TDP-43). Herein, we review current studies on the 
regulation strategies of intracellular LLPS focusing on FUS, which are 
categorized into physical stimuli, biochemical modulators, and protein 
structural modifications, with summarized molecular mechanisms. This review is 
expected to provide a sketch of the modulation of FUS LLPS with its pros and 
cons, and an outlook for the potential clinical treatments of neurodegenerative 
diseases.

A functional mitotic spindle is essential for accurate chromosome congression 
and segregation during cell proliferation; however, the underlying mechanisms of 
its assembly remain unclear. Here we show that NuMA regulates this assembly 
process via phase separation regulated by Aurora A. NuMA undergoes liquid-liquid 
phase separation during mitotic entry and KifC1 facilitates NuMA condensates 
concentrating on spindle poles. Phase separation of NuMA is mediated by its 
C-terminus, whereas its dynein-dynactin binding motif also facilitates this 
process. Phase-separated NuMA droplets concentrate tubulins, bind microtubules, 
and enrich crucial regulators, including Kif2A, at the spindle poles, which then 
depolymerizes spindle microtubules and promotes poleward spindle microtubule 
flux for spindle assembly and structural dynamics. In this work, we show that 
NuMA orchestrates mitotic spindle assembly, structural dynamics and function via 
liquid-liquid phase separation regulated by Aurora A phosphorylation.

At the turn of the twenty-first century, fundamental changes took place in the 
understanding of the structure and function of proteins and then in the 
appreciation of the intracellular space organization. A rather mechanistic model 
of the organization of living matter, where the function of proteins is 
determined by their rigid globular structure, and the intracellular processes 
occur in rigidly determined compartments, was replaced by an idea that highly 
dynamic and multifunctional "soft matter" lies at the heart of all living 
things. According this "new view", the most important role in the 
spatio-temporal organization of the intracellular space is played by 
liquid-liquid phase transitions of biopolymers. These self-organizing cellular 
compartments are open dynamic systems existing at the edge of chaos. They are 
characterized by the exceptional structural and compositional dynamics, and 
their multicomponent nature and polyfunctionality provide means for the finely 
tuned regulation of various intracellular processes. Changes in the external 
conditions can cause a disruption of the biogenesis of these cellular bodies 
leading to the irreversible aggregation of their constituent proteins, followed 
by the transition to a gel-like state and the emergence of amyloid fibrils. This 
work represents a historical overview of changes in our understanding of the 
intracellular space compartmentalization. It also reflects methodological 
breakthroughs that led to a change in paradigms in this area of science and 
discusses modern ideas about the organization of the intracellular space. It is 
emphasized here that the membrane-less organelles have to combine a certain 
resistance to the changes in their environment and, at the same time, show high 
sensitivity to the external signals, which ensures the normal functioning of the 
cell.

The presence or absence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in aerosol 
particles containing oxidized organic species and inorganic salts affects 
particle morphology and influences uptake into, diffusion through, and 
reactivity within those particles. We report here an accessible method, similar 
to ice core analyses, using solutions that are relevant for both aerosol 
chemical systems and aqueous two-phase extraction systems and contain ammonium 
sulfate and one of eight alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 
2-butaonol, 3-methyl-2-butanol, 1,2-propanediol, or 1,3-propanediol) frozen in 
articulated (bendable) straws to probe LLPS. For alcohols with negative 
octanol-water partitioning coefficient (K OW) values and O/C ratios ≥0.5, no 
LLPS occurs, while for alcohols with positive K OW values and O/C ratios ≤0.33, 
phase separation always occurs, both findings consistent with observations using 
different experimental techniques. When a third species, glyoxal, is added, the 
glyoxal stays in the aqueous phase, regardless of whether LLPS occurs. When 
phase separation occurs, the glyoxal forms a strong intermolecular interaction 
with the sulfate ion, red-shifting the ν3(SO4 2-) peak by 15 cm-1. These results 
provide evidence of chemical interactions within phase-separated systems that 
have implications for understanding chemical reactivity within those, and 
related, systems.

Networks of scaffold proteins and enzymes assemble at the interface between the 
cytosol and specific sites of the plasma membrane, where these networks guide 
distinct cellular functions. Some of these plasma membrane-associated platforms 
(PMAPs) include shared core components that are able to establish specific 
protein-protein interactions, to produce distinct supramolecular assemblies 
regulating dynamic processes as diverse as cell adhesion and motility, or the 
formation and function of neuronal synapses. How cells organize such dynamic 
networks is still an open question. In this review we introduce molecular 
networks assembling at the edge of migrating cells, and at pre- and postsynaptic 
sites, which share molecular players that can drive the assembly of biomolecular 
condensates. Very recent experimental evidence has highlighted the emerging role 
of some of these multidomain/scaffold proteins belonging to the GIT, liprin-α 
and ELKS/ERC families as drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The 
data point to an important role of LLPS: (i) in the formation of PMAPs at the 
edge of migrating cells, where LLPS appears to be involved in promoting 
protrusion and the turnover of integrin-mediated adhesions, to allow forward 
cell translocation; (ii) in the assembly of the presynaptic active zone and of 
the postsynaptic density deputed to the release and reception of 
neurotransmitter signals, respectively. The recent results indicate that LLPS at 
cytosol-membrane interfaces is suitable not only for the regulation of active 
cellular processes, but also for the continuous spatial rearrangements of the 
molecular interactions involved in these dynamic processes.

Virus assembly, which takes place during the late stage of viral replication, is 
essential for virus propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain 
poorly understood, especially for viruses with complicated structures. Here, we 
use correlative light and electron microscopy to examine the formation of 
cytoplasmic virion assembly compartments (cVACs) during infection by a 
γ-herpesvirus. These cVACs are membraneless organelles with liquid-like 
properties. Formation of cVACs during virus infection is mediated by ORF52, an 
abundant tegument protein. ORF52 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS), which is promoted by both DNA and RNA. Disrupting ORF52 phase separation 
blocks cVACs formation and virion production. These results demonstrate that 
phase separation of ORF52 is critical for cVACs formation. Our work defines 
herpesvirus cVACs as membraneless compartments that are generated through a 
process of LLPS mediated by a tegument protein and adds to the cellular 
processes that are facilitated by phase separation.

Casein micelles are extracellular polydisperse assemblies of unstructured casein 
proteins. Caseins are the major component of milk. Within casein micelles, 
casein molecules are stabilised by binding to calcium phosphate nanoclusters 
and, by acting as molecular chaperones, through multivalent interactions. In the 
light of such interactions, we discuss whether casein micelles can be considered 
as extracellular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. We 
analyse the sequence, structure and interactions of caseins in comparison with 
proteins forming intracellular condensates. Furthermore, we review the 
similarities between caseins and small heat-shock proteins whose chaperone 
activity is linked to phase separation of proteins. By bringing these 
observations together, we describe a regulatory mechanism for protein 
condensates, as exemplified by casein micelles.

Abnormal deposition of tau in neurons is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and 
several other neurodegenerative disorders. In the past decades, extensive 
efforts have been made to explore the mechanistic pathways underlying the 
development of tauopathies. Recently, the discovery of tau droplet formation by 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has received a great deal of attention. It 
has been reported that tau condensates have a biological role in promoting and 
stabilizing microtubule (MT) assembly. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized 
that the transition of phase-separated tau droplets to a gel-like state and then 
to fibrils is associated with the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. In 
this review, we outline LLPS, the structural disorder that facilitates tau 
droplet formation, the effects of posttranslational modification of tau on 
condensate formation, the physiological function of tau droplets, the pathways 
from droplet to toxic fibrils, and the therapeutic strategies for tauopathies 
that might evolve from toxic droplets. We expect a deeper understanding of tau 
LLPS will provide additional insights into tau physiology and tauopathies.

Conformational conversion of the α-helix-rich cellular prion protein into the 
misfolded, β-rich, aggregated, scrapie form underlies the molecular basis of 
prion diseases that represent a class of invariably fatal, untreatable, and 
transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. However, despite the extensive and 
rigorous research, there is a significant gap in the understanding of molecular 
mechanisms that contribute to prion pathogenesis. In this review, we describe 
the historical perspective of the development of the prion concept and the 
current state of knowledge of prion biology including structural, molecular, and 
cellular aspects of the prion protein. We then summarize the putative functional 
role of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered segment of the prion protein. We 
next describe the ongoing efforts in elucidating the prion phase behavior and 
the emerging role of liquid-liquid phase separation that can have potential 
functional relevance and can offer an alternate non-canonical pathway involving 
conformational conversion into a disease-associated form. We also attempt to 
shed light on the evolutionary perspective of the prion protein highlighting the 
potential role of intrinsic disorder in prion protein biology and summarize a 
few important questions associated with the phase transitions of the prion 
protein. Delving deeper into these key aspects can pave the way for a detailed 
understanding of the critical molecular determinants of the prion phase 
transition and its relevance to physiology and neurodegenerative diseases.

Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer inevitably acquire resistance 
to antiandrogen therapies in part because of androgen receptor (AR) mutations or 
splice variants enabling restored AR signaling. Here we show that 
ligand-activated AR can form transcriptionally active condensates. Both 
structured and unstructured regions of AR contribute to the effective phase 
separation of AR and disordered N-terminal domain plays a predominant role. AR 
liquid-liquid phase separation behaviors faithfully report transcriptional 
activity and antiandrogen efficacy. Antiandrogens can promote phase separation 
and transcriptional activity of AR-resistant mutants in a ligand-independent 
manner. We conducted a phase-separation-based phenotypic screen and identified 
ET516 that specifically disrupts AR condensates, effectively suppresses AR 
transcriptional activity and inhibits the proliferation and tumor growth of 
prostate cancer cells expressing AR-resistant mutants. Our results demonstrate 
liquid-liquid phase separation as an emerging mechanism underlying drug 
resistance and show that targeting phase separation may provide a feasible 
approach for drug discovery.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to identify the association between tumor 
grade and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-related genes, and to generate a 
LLPS-related gene-based risk index (LLPSRI) as a prognostic tool for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: Weighted gene correlation network analysis was performed to test 
whether the LLPS-related gene modules were associated with tumor grade of HCC. 
The candidate modules were subjected to functional enrichment analysis. We 
generated a LLPSRI using the expression profiles of the hub genes among the 
candidate modules in order to identify patients at high risk. Then, the 
biological characteristics of the high-risk patients were revealed using gene 
set enrichment analysis. Additionally, an independent external data set was used 
to validate the LLPSRI.
RESULTS: Four gene modules showed a significant positive correlation with tumor 
grade and involved various cancer-related pathways. Among the hub genes, six 
were selected to generate the LLPSRI, which was significantly associated with 
prognosis of HCC patients. The LLPSRI could successfully divide patients with 
HCC into high- and low-risk groups, and patients in the high-risk group showed 
shorter overall survival than those in the low-risk group. E2F, MYC, and mTORC1 
signaling may be important determinants of survival in the high-risk group. The 
prognostic value of the LLPSRI was validated with the independent external data 
set.
CONCLUSION: We identified LLPS-related gene modules that are associated with HCC 
tumor grade. The LLPSRI may be useful as a prognostic marker of HCC, and it may 
reliably stratify patients into groups at low or high risk of worse survival. 
Our analysis also suggests that certain biological characteristics of HCC may be 
associated with high risk of worse survival.

Mounting evidence has suggested that phase separation, and especially 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), underlies the formation of membraneless 
organelles, which are supramolecular assemblies of proteins and RNA molecules in 
cells. These membraneless organelles are also called biomolecular condensates. 
Evidence is now growing that condensates, such as stress granules, P bodies, 
Cajal bodies, and nucleoli, play vital roles in biological processes, like RNA 
storage and processing, signaling regulation, transcription regulation, gene 
regulation, and transport. Conversely, condensates may cause diseases, such as 
neurodegenerative diseases and tumors, when they go wrong. Condensates initially 
have liquid-like properties, but accumulating biological and chemical mutations 
with age render them into a more solid-like state, like amyloids in Alzheimer's 
disease, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Research into phase 
separation is still in its infancy, but this field is a promising avenue for 
treatment of aging-related diseases.

Previous studies have identified the regulatory roles of circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) in human cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. This study screens the 
expression profile of circRNAs in HCC and identifies circVAMP3 as a 
significantly downregulated circRNA in HCC tissues. HCC patients with low 
circVAMP3 expression present poor prognosis. circVAMP3 negatively regulates the 
proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo by driving phase 
separation of CAPRIN1 and promoting stress granule formation in cells, which can 
downregulate the protein level of Myc proto-oncogene protein by inhibiting c-Myc 
translation. Furthermore, circVAMP3 is widely expressed in many human tissues 
and is downregulated in related cancers. Therefore, circVAMP3 is a potential 
prognostic indicator for HCC and may serve as a therapeutic target for HCC 
treatment.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a reversible biological process that 
contributes to the formation of critical concentration of proteins, forming 
membraneless compartments that are physiologically and pathologically relevant. 
Several proteins have been shown to demix into liquid droplets under in vitro 
crowding conditions. These studies are mainly conducted in isolation using 
purified recombinant proteins. Recently, we used LLPS to study the association 
between two proteins that are co-aggregated in Alzheimer's disease brain, tau, 
and EFhd2. Here, we describe how we used LLPS to determine the molecular 
components that contribute to the transition of these two proteins from liquid 
droplets to solid-like structures.

The 14-3-3 family proteins are vital scaffold proteins that ubiquitously 
expressed in various tissues. They interact with numerous protein targets and 
mediate many cellular signaling pathways. The 14-3-3 binding motifs are often 
embedded in intrinsically disordered regions which are closely associated with 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In the past ten years, LLPS has been 
observed for a variety of proteins and biological processes, indicating that 
LLPS plays a fundamental role in the formation of membraneless organelles and 
cellular condensates. While extensive investigations have been performed on 
14-3-3 proteins, its involvement in LLPS is overlooked. To date, 14-3-3 proteins 
have not been reported to undergo LLPS alone or regulate LLPS of their binding 
partners. To reveal the potential involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in LLPS, in 
this review, we summarized the LLPS propensity of 14-3-3 binding partners and 
found that about one half of them may undergo LLPS spontaneously. We further 
analyzed the phase separation behavior of representative 14-3-3 binders and 
discussed how 14-3-3 proteins may be involved. By modulating the conformation 
and valence of interactions and recruiting other molecules, we speculate that 
14-3-3 proteins can efficiently regulate the functions of their targets in the 
context of LLPS. Considering the critical roles of 14-3-3 proteins, there is an 
urgent need for investigating the involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in the phase 
separation process of their targets and the underling mechanisms.

One of the critical definitions of neurodegenerative diseases is the formation 
of insoluble intracellular inclusion body. These inclusions are found in various 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD). Each inclusion body contains disease-specific proteins and is 
also resistant to common detergent treatments. These aggregates are generally 
ubiquitinated and thus recognized as misfolded by the organism. They are 
observed in residual neurons at the affected sites in each disease, suggesting a 
contribution to disease pathogenesis. The molecular mechanisms for the formation 
of these inclusion bodies remain unclear. Some proteins, such as superoxide 
dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutant that causes familial ALS, are highly aggregative due 
to altered folding caused by point mutations. Still, the aggregates observed in 
neurodegenerative diseases contain wild-type proteins. In recent years, it has 
been reported that the proteins responsible for neurodegenerative diseases 
undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In particular, the ALS/FTD 
causative proteins such as TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and 
fused-in-sarcoma (FUS) undergo LLPS. LLPS increases the local concentration of 
these proteins, and these proteins eventually change their phase from liquid to 
solid (liquid-solid phase transition) due to abnormal folding during repetitive 
separation cycles into two phases and recovery to one phase. In addition to the 
inclusion body formation, sequestration of essential proteins into the LLPS 
droplets or changes in the LLPS status can directly impair neural functions and 
cause diseases. In this review, we will discuss the relationship between the 
LLPS observed in ALS causative proteins and the pathogenesis of the disease and 
outline potential therapeutic approaches.

Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is one of the major 
pathogenic events in Alzheimer's disease and several other neurodegenerative 
disorders. Recent reports have demonstrated that purified tau can undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, forming liquid droplets. The protein 
within these droplets was also found to undergo accelerated transition to 
fibrillar aggregates, suggesting that LLPS may play an important role in 
pathological aggregation of tau in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we 
describe several protocols for studying LLPS behavior of the recombinant 
full-length tau by turbidimetric and light microscopy-based methods.

α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is an aggregation-prone protein whose accumulation in Lewy 
bodies leads to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Calcium plays a critical role in neurons, and calcium dysregulation is one of 
the risk factors of PD. It is known that Ca2+ interacts with α-Syn and affects 
its assembly. However, how Ca2+ regulates α-Syn aggregation remains unclear. 
Here, we reported that Ca2+ accelerates α-Syn amyloid aggregation through the 
modulation of protein phase separation. We observed that Ca2+ promotes the 
formation of α-Syn liquid droplets but does not change the protein fluidity 
inside the droplets. Further studies showed Ca2+-involved α-Syn droplets are 
still able to fuse. A metal chelator eliminated Ca2+-induced enlargement of 
α-Syn droplets, suggesting the influence of Ca2+ on α-Syn assembly could be 
reversed at the stage of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Interestingly, 
our data showed Ca2+ still promoted α-Syn phase separation in the presence of 
the lipid membranes. In addition, Ca2+/α-syn droplets could efficiently recruit 
lipid vesicles to the surface of these condensates. Our findings demonstrate 
that Ca2+ facilitates α-Syn phase separation to accelerate amyloid aggregation 
and pave the path for understanding the implications of Ca2+ in α-Syn 
accumulation and PD.

RNA interactions are exceptionally strong and highly redundant. As such, nearly 
any two RNAs have the potential to interact with one another over relatively 
short stretches, especially at high RNA concentrations. This is especially true 
for pairs of RNAs that do not form strong self-structure. Such phenomena can 
drive liquid-liquid phase separation, either solely from RNA-RNA interactions in 
the presence of divalent or organic cations, or in concert with proteins. RNA 
interactions can drive multimerization of RNA strands via both base-pairing and 
tertiary interactions. In this article, we explore the tendency of RNA to form 
stable monomers, dimers, and higher order structures as a function of RNA length 
and sequence through a focus on the intrinsic thermodynamic, kinetic, and 
structural properties of RNA. The principles we discuss are independent of any 
specific type of biomolecular condensate, and thus widely applicable. We also 
speculate how external conditions experienced by living organisms can influence 
the formation of nonmembranous compartments, again focusing on the physical and 
structural properties of RNA. Plants, in particular, are subject to diverse 
abiotic stresses including extreme temperatures, drought, and salinity. These 
stresses and the cellular responses to them, including changes in the 
concentrations of small molecules such as polyamines, salts, and compatible 
solutes, have the potential to regulate condensate formation by melting or 
strengthening base-pairing. Reversible condensate formation, perhaps including 
regulation by circadian rhythms, could impact biological processes in plants, 
and other organisms.

The recruitment of signaling proteins into activated receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) to produce rapid, high-fidelity downstream response is exposed to the 
ambiguity of random diffusion to the target site. Liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) overcomes this by providing elevated, localized concentrations of the 
required proteins while impeding competitor ligands. Here, we show a subset of 
phosphorylation-dependent RTK-mediated LLPS states. We then investigate the 
formation of phase-separated droplets comprising a ternary complex including the 
RTK, (FGFR2); the phosphatase, SHP2; and the phospholipase, PLCγ1, which 
assembles in response to receptor phosphorylation. SHP2 and activated PLCγ1 
interact through their tandem SH2 domains via a previously undescribed 
interface. The complex of FGFR2 and SHP2 combines kinase and phosphatase 
activities to control the phosphorylation state of the assembly while providing 
a scaffold for active PLCγ1 to facilitate access to its plasma membrane 
substrate. Thus, LLPS modulates RTK signaling, with potential consequences for 
therapeutic intervention.

Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) enables the real-time 
visualization of nanoscale dynamics in solution. This technique has been used to 
study the formation and transformation mechanisms of organic and inorganic 
nanomaterials. Here, we study the formation of block-copolymer-supported 
bilayers using LP-TEM. We observe two formation pathways that involve either 
liquid droplets or vesicles as intermediates toward supported bilayers. 
Quantitative image analysis methods are used to characterize vesicle spread 
rates and show the origin of defect formation in supported bilayers. Our results 
suggest that bilayer assembly methods that proceed via liquid droplet 
intermediates should be beneficial for forming pristine supported bilayers. 
Furthermore, supported bilayers inside the liquid cells may be used to image 
membrane interactions with proteins and nanoparticles in the future.

Eukaryotic cells are intracellularly divided into numerous compartments or 
organelles, which coordinate specific molecules and biological reactions. 
Membrane-bound organelles are physically separated by lipid bilayers from the 
surrounding environment. Biomolecular condensates, also referred to membraneless 
organelles, are micron-scale cellular compartments that lack membranous 
enclosures but function to concentrate proteins and RNA molecules, and these are 
involved in diverse processes. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) driven by 
multivalent weak macromolecular interactions is a critical principle for the 
formation of biomolecular condensates, and a multitude of combinations among 
multivalent interactions may drive liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT). 
Dysregulation of LLPS and LLPT leads to aberrant condensate and amyloid 
formation, which causes many human diseases, including neurodegeneration and 
cancer. Here, we describe recent findings regarding abnormal forms of 
biomolecular condensates and aggregation via aberrant LLPS and LLPT of 
cancer-related proteins in cancer development driven by mutation and fusion of 
genes. Moreover, we discuss the regulatory mechanisms by which aberrant LLPS and 
LLPT occur in cancer and the drug candidates targeting these mechanisms. Further 
understanding of the molecular events regulating how biomolecular condensates 
and aggregation form in cancer tissue is critical for the development of 
therapeutic strategies against tumorigenesis.

Biomolecular condensates and the concept of liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) have transformed cell biology in recent years. Condensates organize 
cellular content and compartmentalize biochemical reactions, in particular many 
processes involving RNA. This protocol is aimed at readers new to the LLPS field 
who want to test their protein or cellular structure of interest. We describe 
the basic principles of liquid-liquid phase separation, and outline initial 
approaches-both in vitro and in yeast cells-for the characterization of a 
candidate cellular condensate. First, we focus on strategies to purify 
phase-separating proteins and to reconstitute condensates from recombinant 
proteins in vitro for observation by light microscopy. Second, we describe in 
vivo experiments (including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 
microscopy and 1,6-Hexanediol treatment) to test whether a subcellular structure 
displays liquid-like behavior in cells.

Viscoelastic liquid coacervate phases that are highly enriched in nonconjugated 
polyelectrolytes are currently the subject of highly active research from 
biological and soft-materials perspectives. However, formation of a liquid, 
electronically active coacervate has proved highly elusive, since extended 
π-electron interactions strongly favor the solid state. Herein we show that a 
conjugated polyelectrolyte can be rationally designed to undergo aqueous 
liquid/liquid phase separation to form a liquid coacervate phase. This result is 
significant both because it adds to the fundamental understanding of 
liquid/liquid phase separation but also because it opens intriguing applications 
in light harvesting and beyond. We find that the semiconducting coacervate is 
intrinsically excitonically coupled, allowing for long-range exciton diffusion 
in a strongly correlated, fluctuating environment. The emergent excitonic states 
are comprised of both excimers and H-aggregates.

Liquid-liquid phase separation or LLPS of proteins is a field of mounting 
importance and the value of quantitative kinetic and thermodynamic 
characterization of LLPS is increasingly recognized. We present a method, 
Capflex, which allows rapid and accurate quantification of key parameters for 
LLPS: Dilute phase concentration, relative droplet size distributions, and the 
kinetics of droplet formation and maturation into amyloid fibrils. The binding 
affinity between the polypeptide undergoing LLPS and LLPS-modulating compounds 
can also be determined. We apply Capflex to characterize the LLPS of Human 
DEAD-box helicase-4 and the coacervate system ssDNA/RP3. Furthermore, we study 
LLPS and the aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transition of α-synuclein. We 
quantitatively measure the decrease in dilute phase concentration as the LLPS of 
α-synuclein is followed by the formation of Thioflavin-T positive amyloid 
aggregates. The high information content, throughput and the versatility of 
Capflex makes it a valuable tool for characterizing biomolecular LLPS.

Some animal organs contain mineralized tissues. These so-called hard tissues are 
mostly deposits of calcium salts, usually in the form of calcium phosphate or 
calcium carbonate. Examples of this include fish otoliths and mammalian 
otoconia, which are found in the inner ear, and they are an essential part of 
the sensory system that maintains body balance. The composition of ear stones is 
quite well known, but the role of individual components in the nucleation and 
growth of these biominerals is enigmatic. It is sure that intrinsically 
disordered proteins (IDPs) play an important role in this aspect. They have an 
impact on the shape and size of otoliths. It seems probable that IDPs, with 
their inherent ability to phase separate, also play a role in nucleation 
processes. This review discusses the major theories on the mechanisms of 
biomineral nucleation with a focus on the importance of protein-driven 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). It also presents the current 
understanding of the role of IDPs in the formation of calcium carbonate 
biominerals and predicts their potential ability to drive LLPS.

Hyperosmotic stress as physiologic dysfunction can reduce the cell volume and 
then redistribute both protein concentration and ionic strength, but its effect 
on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is not well understood. Here, we map 
the hyperosmotic-stress-induced nuclear LLPS of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS)-related proteins (fused in sarcoma [FUS], TAR DNA-binding protein 43 
[TDP-43]). The dynamic and reversibility of FUS granules are continuable with 
the increase of hypertonic stimulation time, but those of TDP-43 granules 
decrease significantly. Strikingly, FUS granules, but not TDP-43 granules, 
contain essential chaperone Hsp40, which can protect amyloid protein from solid 
aggregation. Moreover, FUS nuclear granules can co-localize with paraspeckles, 
but not promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies or nuclear speckles, while TDP-43 
nuclear granules cannot co-localize with the above nuclear bodies. Together, 
these results may broaden our understanding of the LLPS of ALS-related proteins 
in response to cellular stress.

Biomolecular phase separation is currently emerging in both the medical and life 
science fields. Meanwhile, the application of liquid-liquid phase separation has 
been extended to many fields including drug discovery, fibrous material 
fabrication, 3D printing, and polymer design. Although more than 8600 proteins 
and other synthetic macromolecules are capable of phase separation as recently 
reported, there is still a lack of a high-throughput approach to quantitatively 
characterize its phase behaviors. To meet this requirement, here, we proposed 
fast and high-resolution acquisition of biomolecular phase diagrams using 
microfluidic chips. Using this platform, we demonstrated the phase behavior of 
polyU/RRASLRRASLRRASL in a quantitative manner. Up to 1750 concentration 
conditions can be generated in 140 min. The detection limitation of our device 
to capture the saturation concentration for phase separation is about 5 times 
lower than that of the traditional turbidity method. Thus, our results provide a 
basis for the rapid acquisition of phase diagrams with high-throughput and pave 
the way for its wide application.

Liquid-liquid phase separation is a phenomenon within biology whereby proteins 
can separate into dense and more dilute phases with distinct properties. Three 
antibodies that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation were characterized in the 
protein-rich and protein-poor phases. In comparison to the protein-poor phase, 
the protein-rich phase demonstrates more blue-shift tryptophan emissions and 
red-shifted amide I absorbances. Large changes involving conformational 
isomerization around disulfide bonds were observed using Raman spectroscopy. 
Amide I and protein fluorescence differences between the phases persisted to 
temperatures above the critical temperature but ceased at the temperature at 
which aggregation occurred. In addition, large changes occurred in the 
structural organization of water molecules within the protein-rich phase for all 
three antibodies. It is hypothesized that as the proteins have the same chemical 
potential in both phases, the protein viscosity is higher in the protein-rich 
phase resulting in slowed diffusion dependent protein aggregation in this phase. 
For all three antibodies we performed accelerated stability studies and found 
that the protein-rich phase aggregated at the same rate or slower than the 
protein-poor phase.

The underwater adhesive prowess of aquatic mussels has been largely attributed 
to the abundant post-translationally modified amino acid 
l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) in mussel foot proteins (MFPs) that make up 
their adhesive threads. More recently, it has been suggested that during thread 
fabrication, MFPs form intermediate fluidic phases such as liquid crystals or 
coacervates regulated by a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) process. Here, 
it is shown that Dopa plays another central role during mussel fiber formation, 
by enabling LLPS of Pvfp-5β, a main MFP of the green mussel Perna viridis. Using 
residue-specific substitution of Tyrosine (Tyr) for Dopa during recombinant 
expression, Dopa-substituted Pvfp-5β is shown to exhibit LLPS under 
seawater-like conditions, whereas the Tyr-only version forms insoluble 
aggregates. Combining quantum chemistry calculations and solution NMR, a 
transient H-bonding network requiring the two hydroxyl groups of Dopa is found 
to be critical to enable LLPS in Dopa-mutated Pvfp-5β. Overall, the study 
suggests that Dopa plays an important role in regulating LLPS of MFPs, which may 
be critical to concentrate the adhesive proteins at the plaque/substrate 
interface and therefore produce a more robust adhesive. The findings also 
provide molecular-level lessons to guide biomanufacturing of protein-based 
materials such as bioadhesives and load-bearing fibers.

The phenomenon of liquid-liquid phase separation is found in numerous biological 
processes. The biomolecules enveloped in the phase-separated droplets experience 
an obviously different environment from those in cellular or aqueous solution. 
Herein, we quantitatively characterized the thermodynamics and exchange kinetics 
of a model protein SH3 domain in the condensed phase of an intrinsically 
disordered region of a germ cell-specific protein DDX4N1 by using 19F-NMR 
spectroscopy. The stability and exchange rate of the SH3 domain are different 
from those in buffer and macromolecular crowding conditions. Our finding 
indicates that the local transient ordered microstructure and heterogeneity in 
the condensates play significant roles in modulating the biophysical properties 
of the enveloped proteins, and this finding may be essential to further our 
understanding how phase separation regulates the function of proteins in cells.

Endocytosis is a fine-tuned mechanism of cellular communication through which 
cells internalize molecules on the plasma membrane, such as receptors and their 
bound ligands. Through receptor clustering in endocytic pits, recruitment of 
active receptors to different endocytic routes and their trafficking towards 
different fates, endocytosis modulates cell signaling and ultimately leads to a 
variety of biological responses. Many studies have focused their attention on 
specialized endocytic mechanisms depending on the nature of the internalizing 
cargo and cellular context, distinct sets of coat proteins, endocytic adaptors 
and membrane lipids. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the 
principles underlying endocytic vesicle formation, integrating both biochemical 
and biophysical factors, with a particular focus on intrinsically disordered 
regions (IDRs) creating weakly interconnected protein networks assembled through 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and driving membrane bending especially in 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). We finally discuss how these properties 
impinge on receptor fate and signaling.

Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau aggregates have been 
widely accepted as an important pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. 
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of Tau can lead to its aggregation, and 
Tau aggregation can then be enhanced by zinc. However, it is unclear whether 
zinc modulates the formation of Tau stress granules in cells. We herein report 
that zinc promotes the formation of stress granules containing a pathological 
mutant ΔK280 of full-length human Tau. Furthermore, zinc promotes LLPS of ΔK280 
of full-length Tau, shifting the equilibrium phase boundary to a lower protein 
concentration, and modulates the liquid nature of droplets formed by this 
pathological mutation. Zinc also promotes pathological phosphorylation of ΔK280 
in neuronal cells, and aggravates mitochondrial damage and elevates reactive 
oxygen species production induced by Tau aggregation. Importantly, we show that 
treatment of cells with zinc increases the interaction between full-length Tau 
and G3BP1 inside stress granules to promote the formation of Tau filaments and 
increase Tau toxicity in neuronal cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate 
how Tau condensation and mitochondrial damages induced by Tau aggregation are 
enhanced by zinc to deteriorate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, 
bridging the gap between Tau LLPS and aggregation in neuronal cells.

Protein phase separation is a major governing factor in multiple cellular 
processes, such as RNA metabolism and those involving RNA-binding proteins. 
Despite many key observations, the exact structural characteristics of proteins 
involved in the phase separation process are still not fully deciphered. In this 
work, we show that proteins harbouring sequence regions with specific charged 
residue patterns are significantly associated with liquid-liquid phase 
separation. In particular, regions with repetitive arrays of alternating charges 
show the strongest association, whereas segments with generally high charge 
density and single α-helices also show detectable but weaker connections.

The high colloidal stability of antibody (immunoglobulin) solutions is important 
for pharmaceutical applications. Inert cosolutes, excipients, are generally used 
in therapeutic protein formulations to minimize physical instabilities, such as 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), aggregation and precipitation, which are 
often encountered during manufacturing and storage. Despite their widespread 
use, a detailed understanding of how excipients modulate the specific 
protein-protein interactions responsible for these instabilities is still 
lacking. In this work, we demonstrate the high sensitivity to pressure of 
globulin condensates as a suitable means to suppress LLPS and subsequent 
aggregation of concentrated antibody solutions. The addition of excipients has 
only a minor effect. The high pressure sensitivity observed is due to the fact 
that these flexible Y-shaped molecules create a considerable amount of void 
volume in the condensed phase, leading to an overall decrease in the volume of 
the system upon dissociation of the droplet phase by pressure already at a few 
tens of to hundred bar. Moreover, we show that immunoglobulin molecules 
themselves are highly resistant to unfolding under pressure, and can even 
sustain pressures up to about 6 kbar without conformational changes. This 
implies that immunoglobulins are resistant to the pressure treatment of foods, 
such as milk, in high-pressure food-processing technologies, thereby preserving 
their immunological activity.

Sex differences are pervasive in human health and disease. One major key to 
sex-biased differences lies in the sex chromosomes. Although the functions of 
the X chromosome proteins are well appreciated, how they compare with their Y 
chromosome homologs remains elusive. Herein, using ensemble and single-molecule 
techniques, we report that the sex chromosome-encoded RNA helicases DDX3X and 
DDX3Y are distinct in their propensities for liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS), dissolution, and translation repression. We demonstrate that the 
N-terminal intrinsically disordered region of DDX3Y more strongly promotes LLPS 
than the corresponding region of DDX3X and that the weaker ATPase activity of 
DDX3Y, compared with DDX3X, contributes to the slower disassembly dynamics of 
DDX3Y-positive condensates. Interestingly, DDX3Y-dependent LLPS represses mRNA 
translation and enhances aggregation of FUS more strongly than DDX3X-dependent 
LLPS. Our study provides a platform for future comparisons of sex 
chromosome-encoded protein homologs, providing insights into sex differences in 
RNA metabolism and human disease.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidences have indicated that the aberrant liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) leads to the dysfunction of biomolecular condensates, 
thereby contributing to the tumorigenesis and progression. Nevertheless, it 
remains unclear whether or how the LLPS of specific molecules affects the 
prognosis and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of patients with lower-grade 
glioma (LGG).
METHODS: We integrated the transcriptome information of 3585 LLPS-related genes 
to comprehensively evaluate the LLPS patterns of 423 patients with LGG in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Then, we systematically demonstrated the 
differences among four LLPS subtypes based on multi-omics analyses. In addition, 
we constructed the LLPS-related prognostic risk score (LPRS) for individualized 
integrative assessment.
RESULTS: Based on the expression profiles of 85 scaffolds, 355 regulators, and 
3145 clients in LGG, we identified four LLPS subtypes, namely LS1, LS2, LS3 and 
LS4. We confirmed that there were significant differences in prognosis, 
clinicopathological features, cancer hallmarks, genomic alterations, TIME 
patterns and immunotherapeutic responses among four LLPS subtypes. In addition, 
a prognostic signature called LPRS was constructed for individualized 
integrative assessment. LPRS exhibited a robust predictive capacity for 
prognosis of LGG patients in multiple cohorts. Moreover, LPRS was found to be 
correlated with clinicopathological features, cancer hallmarks, genomic 
alterations and TIME patterns of LGG patients. The predictive power of LPRS in 
response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy was also prominent.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a novel classification of LGG patients based on 
LLPS. The constructed LPRS might facilitate individualized prognosis prediction 
and better immunotherapy options for LGG patients.

We constructed a minimum liquid-liquid phase separation model system to form 
liquid droplets using only G-quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides and R- and 
G-rich oligopeptides. We found that the G-quadruplex structure is an essential 
component for RNA to form droplets with the peptide. Based on this model system 
and our findings, droplet redissolution via structure transition from a 
G-quadruplex to a duplex was achieved in a sequence-specific manner.

Plastics are one of the most widely used polymeric materials. However, they are 
often undegradable and non-recyclable due to the very stable covalent bonds of 
macromolecules, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Here, we 
report that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) could drive the formation of 
robust, stable, and sustainable plastics using small molecules. The LLPS process 
could sequester and concentrate solutes, strengthen the non-covalent association 
between molecules and produce a bulk material whose property was highly related 
to the encapsulated water amounts. It was a robust plastic with a remarkable 
Young's modulus of 139.5 MPa when the water content was low while became 
adhesive and could instantly self-heal with more absorbed water. Finally, 
responsiveness enabled the material to be highly recyclable. This work allowed 
us to understand the LLPS at the molecular level and demonstrated that LLPS is a 
promising approach to exploring eco-friendly supramolecular plastics that are 
potential substitutes for conventional polymers.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), also known as oiling-out, is the 
appearance of the second liquid phase preceding the crystallization. LLPS is an 
undesirable phenomenon that can occur during the crystallization of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), proteins, and polymers. It is typically 
avoided during crystallization due to its detrimental impacts on crystalline 
products due to lowered crystallization rate, the inclusion of impurities, and 
alteration in particle morphology and size distribution. In situ monitoring of 
phase separation enables investigating LLPS and identifying the phase separation 
boundaries. Various process analytical technologies (PATs) have been implemented 
to determine the LLPS boundaries prior to crystallization to prevent oiling out 
of compounds. The LLPS measurements using PATs can be time-consuming, expensive, 
and challenging. Here, we have implemented a fully integrated continuous-flow 
microfluidic device with a turbidity sensor to quickly and accurately evaluate 
the LLPS boundaries for a β-alanine, water, and IPA mixture. The 
turbidity-sensor-integrated continuous-flow microfluidic device is also placed 
under an optical microscope to visually track and record the appearance and 
disappearance of oil droplets. Streams of an aqueous solution of β-alanine, pure 
solvent (water), and pure antisolvent (IPA or ethanol) are pumped into the 
continuous-flow microfluidic device at various flow rates to obtain the 
compositions at which the solution becomes turbid. The onset of turbidity is 
measured using a custom-designed, in-line turbidity sensor. The LLPS boundaries 
can be estimated using the turbidity-sensor-integrated microfluidic device in 
less than 30 min, which will significantly improve and enhance the workflow of 
the pharmaceutical drug (or crystalline material) development process.

Intrinsically disordered proteins rich in cationic amino acid groups can undergo 
Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in the presence of charge-balancing 
anionic counterparts. Arginine and Lysine are the two most prevalent cationic 
amino acids in proteins that undergo LLPS, with arginine-rich proteins observed 
to undergo LLPS more readily than lysine-rich proteins, a feature commonly 
attributed to arginine's ability to form stronger cation-π interactions with 
aromatic groups. Here, we show that arginine's ability to promote LLPS is 
independent of the presence of aromatic partners, and that arginine-rich 
peptides, but not lysine-rich peptides, display re-entrant phase behavior at 
high salt concentrations. We further demonstrate that the hydrophobicity of 
arginine is the determining factor giving rise to the reentrant phase behavior 
and tunable viscoelastic properties of the dense LLPS phase. Controlling 
arginine-induced reentrant LLPS behavior using temperature and salt 
concentration opens avenues for the bioengineering of stress-triggered 
biological phenomena and drug delivery systems.

Protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays an essential role in the 
dynamic assembly of various membraneless compartments, which fulfill different 
biological functions in cells. Numerous proteins were found to undergo LLPS in 
different conditions. However, a general approach to systemically identify and 
compare the LLPS ability of different proteins is lacking. Here, we introduce a 
high-throughput protein phase separation (HiPPS) profiling method to evaluate 
the LLPS ability of proteins using a combination of crystallization robot/manual 
mixing mode and high-content analysis system. This method enables us to rapidly 
and comprehensively explore the LLPS behavior of each individual protein as well 
as mixture of different proteins.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of protein solutions is increasingly 
recognised as an important phenomenon in cell biology and biotechnology. 
However, opalescence and concentration fluctuations render LLPS difficult to 
study, particularly when characterising the kinetics of the phase transition and 
layer separation. Here, we demonstrate the use of a probe molecule 
trifluoroethanol (TFE) to characterise the kinetics of protein LLPS by NMR 
spectroscopy. The chemical shift and linewidth of the probe molecule are 
sensitive to local protein concentration, with this sensitivity resulting in 
different characteristic signals arising from the dense and lean phases. 
Monitoring of these probe signals by conventional bulk-detection 19F NMR reports 
on the formation and evolution of both phases throughout the sample, including 
their concentrations and volumes. Meanwhile, spatially-selective 19F NMR, in 
which spectra are recorded from smaller slices of the sample, was used to track 
the distribution of the different phases during layer separation. This 
experimental strategy enables comprehensive characterisation of the process and 
kinetics of LLPS, and may be useful to study phase separation in protein systems 
as a function of their environment.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is hypothesized to be the underlying 
mechanism for how membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates form 
inside both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Protein LLPS is a biophysical 
process during which proteins demix from homogeneous solution to form 
protein-dense droplets with liquid-like properties. Disruptions to LLPS, such as 
changes to material properties of condensates or physicochemical parameters for 
LLPS onset, are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Therefore, 
it is essential to determine the physicochemical parameters that promote protein 
LLPS. Here, we present our UV-Vis spectrophotometric turbidity assay to 
characterize the temperature and concentration dependence of LLPS for UBQLN2, a 
protein that undergoes LLPS via homotypic interactions in vitro and forms 
stress-induced condensates in cells. Mutations in UBQLN2 cause amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and disrupt UBQLN2 LLPS. We present a detailed 
expression and purification protocol for a C-terminal construct of UBQLN2 and 
how we use microscopy to image UBQLN2 LLPS. We use our UV-Vis assay to construct 
temperature-concentration phase diagrams for wild-type and mutant UBQLN2 
constructs to determine the effects of domain deletions and/or mutations on 
UBQLN2 phase separation.

Particles can undergo different phase transitions in the atmosphere including 
deliquescence, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), melting, and freezing. In 
this study, phase transitions of particles/droplets containing polyethylene 
glycol with a molar mass of 400 g mol-1 (PEG400) and ammonium sulfate (AS), 
i.e., PEG400-AS particles/droplets, were investigated at different 
organic-to-inorganic dry mass ratios (OIRs) under typical tropospheric 
temperatures and water activities (aw). The investigated droplets (60-100 μm) 
with or without LLPS in the closed system froze through homogeneous ice 
nucleation. At temperatures lower than 200 K, multiple ice nucleation events 
were observed within the same individual droplets at low aw. Droplets with and 
without LLPS shared similar lambda values at the same OIR according to the 
lambda approach indicating they form ice through the same mechanism. A 
parameterization of lambda values was provided which can be used to predict 
freezing temperature of aqueous PEG400-AS droplets. We found that adding AS 
reduces the temperature dependence of aw in aqueous PEG400 droplets. Assuming 
incorrectly that aw is temperature-independent for a constant droplet 
composition leads to a deviation between the experimental determined ice 
nucleation rate coefficients for droplets at OIR > 1 and the predicted values by 
the water-activity-based ice nucleation theory. We proposed a parameterization 
of temperature dependence of aw to minimize the deviations of the measured 
melting temperatures and nucleation rate coefficients from the corresponding 
predictions for aqueous PEG400-AS system.

Living cells comprise diverse subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal 
networks, which can regulate essential cellular activities through dynamic 
assembly and synergistic interactions with biomolecular condensates. Despite 
extensive efforts, reproducing viscoelastic networks for modulating biomolecular 
condensates in synthetic systems remains challenging. Here, a new aqueous 
two-phase system (ATPS) is proposed, which consists of 
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and dextran (DEX), to construct 
viscoelastic networks capable of being assembled and dissociated dynamically to 
regulate the self-assembly of condensates on-demand. Viscoelastic networks are 
generated using liquid-liquid phase-separated DEX droplets as templates and the 
following liquid-to-solid transition of the PNIPAM-rich phase. The resulting 
networks can dissolve liquid fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates within 5 min. 
This work demonstrates rich phase-separation behaviors in a single ATPS through 
incorporating stimuli-responsive polymers. The concept can potentially be

Type II topoisomerases modulate chromosome supercoiling, condensation, and 
catenation by moving one double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break 
in a second duplex. How DNA strands are chosen and selectively passed to yield 
appropriate topological outcomes - for example, decatenation vs. catenation - is 
poorly understood. Here, we show that at physiological enzyme concentrations, 
eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases (topo IIs) readily coalesce into condensed 
bodies. DNA stimulates condensation and fluidizes these assemblies to impart 
liquid-like behavior. Condensation induces both budding yeast and human topo IIs 
to switch from DNA unlinking to active DNA catenation, and depends on an 
unstructured C-terminal region, the loss of which leads to high levels of 
knotting and reduced catenation. Our findings establish that local protein 
concentration and phase separation can regulate how topo II creates or dissolves 
DNA links, behaviors that can account for the varied roles of the enzyme in 
supporting transcription, replication, and chromosome compaction.

The dynamic regulation of the physical states of chromatin in the cell nucleus 
is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Chromatin can exist in solid- 
or liquid-like forms depending on the surrounding ions, binding proteins, 
post-translational modifications and many other factors. Several recent studies 
suggested that chromatin undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in 
vitro and also in vivo; yet, controversial conclusions about the nature of 
chromatin LLPS were also observed from the in vitro studies. These 
inconsistencies are partially due to deviations in the in vitro buffer 
conditions that induce the condensation/aggregation of chromatin as well as to 
differences in chromatin (nucleosome array) constructs used in the studies. In 
this work, we present a detailed characterization of the effects of K+, Mg2+ and 
nucleosome fiber length on the physical state and property of reconstituted 
nucleosome arrays. LLPS was generally observed for shorter nucleosome arrays 
(15-197-601, reconstituted from 15 repeats of the Widom 601 DNA with 197 bp 
nucleosome repeat length) at physiological ion concentrations. In contrast, gel- 
or solid-like condensates were detected for the considerably longer 62-202-601 
and lambda DNA (~48.5 kbp) nucleosome arrays under the same conditions. In 
addition, we demonstrated that the presence of reduced BSA and acetate buffer is 
not essential for the chromatin LLPS process. Overall, this study provides a 
comprehensive understanding of several factors regarding chromatin physical 
states and sheds light on the mechanism and biological relevance of chromatin 
phase separation in vivo.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered proteins 
(IDPs) and the action of molecular chaperones are tightly connected. An 
important class of molecular chaperones are peptidyl prolyl isomerases, which 
enhance the cis/trans-isomerization of proline. However, little is known about 
the impact of peptidyl prolyl isomerases on the LLPS of IDPs, which often 
contain many prolines. Here, we demonstrate that the most ubiquitous peptidyl 
prolyl isomerase, peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA), concentrates inside 
liquid-like droplets formed by the Alzheimer's disease-associated protein tau, 
as well as inside RNA-induced coacervates of a proline-arginine dipeptide repeat 
protein. We further show that the recruitment of PPIA into the IDP droplets 
triggers their dissolution and return to a single mixed phase. NMR-based binding 
and proline isomerization studies provide insights into the mechanism of LLPS 
modulation. Together, the results establish a regulatory role of proline 
isomerases on the liquid-liquid phase separation of proline-rich IDPs.

Studying pathogenic effects of amyloids requires homogeneous amyloidogenic 
peptide samples. Recombinant production of these peptides is challenging due to 
their susceptibility to aggregation and chemical modifications. Thus, chemical 
synthesis is primarily used to produce amyloidogenic peptides suitable for 
high-resolution structural studies. Here, we exploited the shielded environment 
of protein condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a 
protective mechanism against premature aggregation. We designed a fusion protein 
tag undergoing LLPS in Escherichia coli and linked it to highly amyloidogenic 
peptides, including β amyloids. We find that the fusion proteins form 
membraneless organelles during overexpression and remain fluidic-like. We also 
developed a facile purification method of functional Aβ peptides free of 
chromatography steps. The strategy exploiting LLPS can be applied to other 
amyloidogenic, hydrophobic, and repetitive peptides that are otherwise difficult 
to produce.

This study describes a miniaturized approach for liquid-liquid microextraction 
based on mass transfer into low volume of deep eutectic solvent and magnetic 
phase separation, using specially produced magnetic chromium dioxide 
nanoparticles with a hydrophobic surface layer of fatty acids. The nanoparticles 
modified with fatty acid helped to recover low volumes of viscous hydrophobic 
deep eutectic solvent-based extract reproducibly and easily (up to 10 μL) in a 
microextraction procedure with the application of magnetic forces. It was 
demonstrated that the collector properties depend on nanoparticles' surface and 
magnetic characteristics. The developed approach was implemented for the 
separation and preconcentration of trace fluoroquinolone antibiotics from 
environmental waters prior to their determination by high-performance liquid 
chromatography with fluorometric detection as a model analytical task. The 
limits of detection, calculated from a blank test based on 3σ, were 0.01 μg L-1 
for ofloxacin, 0.02 μg L-1 for lomefloxacin and fleroxacin, and 0.04 μg L-1 for 
norfloxacin. The procedure provides significant solvent reduction and high 
enrichment factors. The approach is green, which is proved by the analytical 
eco-scale assessment tool with the total score equal to 85 out of 100.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of polymer and protein solutions is central in 
many areas of biology and material sciences. Here, an experimental and 
theoretical framework is provided to investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics 
of liquid-liquid phase separation in volumes comparable to cells. The strategy 
leverages droplet microfluidics to accurately measure the volume of the dense 
phase generated by liquid-liquid phase separation of solutions confined in 
micro-sized compartments. It is shown that the measurement of the volume 
fraction of the dense phase at different temperatures allows the evaluation of 
the binodal lines that determine the coexistence region of the two phases in the 
temperature-concentration phase diagram. By applying a thermodynamic model of 
phase separation in finite volumes, it is further shown that the platform can 
predict and validate kinetic barriers associated with the formation of a dense 
droplet in a parent dilute phase, therefore connecting thermodynamics and 
kinetics of liquid-liquid phase separation.

Insulin signals through its receptor to recruit insulin receptor substrates 
(IRS) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to the plasma membrane for 
production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], which consequently activates 
protein kinase B (PKB). How insulin signals transduce from the plasma membrane 
into the cytoplasm is not clearly understood. Here we show that liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) plays a critical role in spatiotemporal control of 
insulin signaling through regulating multiple components including IRS1. Both 
protein concentration and insulin stimulation can drive the formation of 
intracellular IRS1 condensates through LLPS. Components including PI(4,5)P2, 
p85-PI3K and PDK1 are constitutively present in IRS1 condensates whereas 
production of PIP3 and recruitment of PKB in them are induced by insulin. Thus, 
IRS1 condensates function as intracellular signal hubs to mediate insulin 
signaling, whose formation is impaired in insulin resistant cells. Collectively, 
these data reveal an important function of LLPS in spatiotemporal control of 
insulin signaling.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a process that results in the formation 
of a polymer-rich liquid phase coexisting with a polymer-depleted liquid phase. 
LLPS plays a critical role in the cell through the formation of membrane-less 
organelles, but it also has a number of biotechnical and biomedical applications 
such as drug confinement and its targeted delivery. In this chapter, we present 
a computational efficient methodology that uses field-theoretic simulations 
(FTS) with complex Langevin (CL) sampling to characterize polymer phase behavior 
and delineate the LLPS phase boundaries. This approach is a powerful complement 
to analytical and explicit-particle simulations, and it can serve to inform 
experimental LLPS studies. The strength of the method lies in its ability to 
properly sample a large ensemble of polymers in a saturated solution while 
including the effect of composition fluctuations on LLPS. We describe the 
approaches that can be used to accurately construct phase diagrams of a variety 
of molecularly designed polymers and illustrate the method by generating an 
approximation-free phase diagram for a classical symmetric diblock 
polyampholyte.

Objective: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a functional unit formed by 
specific molecules. It lacks a membrane and has been reported to play a crucial 
role in tumor drug resistance and growth by regulating gene expression and drug 
distribution. However, whether LLPS could be used to predict cancer prognosis 
was not clear. This study aimed to construct a prognostic model for breast 
cancer based on LLPS-correlated genes (LCGs). Methods: LCGs were identified 
using the PhaSepDB, gene expression profile and clinical characteristics of 
breast cancer were obtained from TCGA and cBioportal. The PanCancer Atlas (TCGA) 
cohort was used as the training cohort to construct the prognostic model, while 
the Nature 2012 and Nat Commun 2016 (TCGA) cohort and GEO data were used as test 
cohort to perform external verification. Data analysis was performed with R4.2.0 
and SPSS20.0. Results: We identified 140 prognosis-related LCGs (pLCGs) (p< 
0.01) in all cohorts, 240 pLCGs (p< 0.01) in the luminal cohort, and 28 pLCGs 
(p< 0.05) in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cohort. Twelve genes in 
all cohorts (training cohort: 5/10-year ROC values were 0.76 and 0.77; 
verification cohort: 5/10-year ROC values were 0.61 and 0.58), eight genes in 
the luminal cohort (training cohort: 5/10-year ROC values were 0.79 and 0.75; 
verification cohort: 5/10-year ROC values were 0.62 and 0.62), and four genes in 
the TNBC cohort (training cohort: 5/10-year ROC values were 0.73 and 0.79; 
verification cohort: 5/10-year ROC values were 0.55 and 0.54) were screened out 
to construct the prognostic prediction model. The 17-gene risk-score was 
constructed in all cohorts (1/3/5-year ROC values were 0.88, 0.83, and 0.81), 
and the 11-gene risk-score was constructed in the luminal cohort (1/3/5-year ROC 
values were 0.67, 0.85 and 0.84), and the six-gene risk-score was constructed in 
the TNBC cohort (1/3/5-year ROC value were 0.87, 0.88 and 0.81). Finally, the 
risk-score and clinical factors were applied to construct nomograms in all 
cohorts (1/3/5-year ROC values were 0.89, 0.79 and 0.75, C-index = 0.784), in 
the luminal cohort (1/3/5-year ROC values were 0.84, 0.83 and 0.85, C-index = 
0.803), and in the TNBC cohort (1/3/5-year ROC values were 0.95, 0.84 and 0.77, 
C-index = 0.847). Discussion: This study explored the roles of LCGs in the 
prediction of breast cancer prognosis.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are essential players in the assembly 
of biomolecular condensates during liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). 
Disordered regions (IDRs) are significantly exposed to the solvent and, 
therefore, highly influenced by fluctuations in the microenvironment. Extrinsic 
factors, such as pH, modify the solubility and disorder state of IDPs, which in 
turn may impact the formation of liquid condensates. However, little attention 
has been paid to how the solution pH influences LLPS, despite knowing that this 
process is context-dependent. Here, we have conducted a large-scale in-silico 
analysis of pH-dependent solubility and disorder in IDRs known to be involved in 
LLPS (LLPS-DRs). We found that LLPS-DRs present maximum solubility around 
physiological pH, where LLPS often occurs, and identified significant 
differences in solubility and disorder between proteins that can phase-separate 
by themselves or those that require a partner. We also analyzed the effect of 
mutations in the resulting solubility profiles of LLPS-DRs and discussed how, as 
a general trend, LLPS-DRs display physicochemical properties that permit their 
LLPS at physiologically relevant pHs.

Evaporating a sessile drop of ternary solutions containing one hydrotrope (such 
as ethanol) and two immiscible fluids exhibiting fascinating phase separation 
behaviours, has opened up a new pathway for controlled nanomaterial assembly. In 
this work, we studied the influence of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) on 
the assembly of carbon nanodots (C-dots), 2 nm fluorescent carbon-based 
nanomaterials with high water solubility. Through self-evaporation of a 
micro-sized droplet containing ethanol, C-dot-water solution and different oils 
on a hydrophobic surface, C-dots rearranged into film, porous and granular 
structures by controlling the properties of oil component in the tenary droplet. 
Vapour pressure, solubility, surface tension and compositions of the oil 
components were investigated systematically for their impacts on the evaporation 
process of C-dot-laden droplets. By using confocal microscopy, we clearly 
revealed that C-dot assembly was triggered by LLPS in these four 
oil-water-ethanol ternary systems. The corresponding evaporation and assembly 
processes were unravelled to be determined by how the ternary solutions pass 
through the liquid-liquid equilibrium curves in the phase diagrams during 
evaporation. Our findings deepen the understanding of phase-separation 
behaviours for nanomaterial assembly as well as provide a novel, simple, and 
well-controlled approach for depositing different C-dot based nanostructures 
onto surfaces, which will benefit a wide range of practical applications in the 
fields of energy, environment and health.

Mounting evidence implicates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), the 
condensation of biomolecules into liquid-like droplets in the formation and 
dissolution of membraneless intracellular organelles (MLOs). Cells use MLOs or 
condensates for various biological processes, including emergency signaling and 
spatiotemporal control over steady-state biochemical reactions and 
heterochromatin formation. Insulator proteins are architectural elements 
involved in establishing independent domains of transcriptional activity within 
eukaryotic genomes. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, insulator proteins form 
nuclear foci known as insulator bodies in response to osmotic stress. However, 
the mechanism through which insulator proteins assemble into bodies is yet to be 
investigated. Here, we identify signatures of LLPS by insulator bodies, 
including high disorder tendency in insulator proteins, 
scaffold-client-dependent assembly, extensive fusion behavior, sphericity, and 
sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol. We also show that the cohesin subunit Rad21 is a 
component of insulator bodies, adding to the known insulator protein 
constituents and γH2Av. Our data suggest a concerted role of cohesin and 
insulator proteins in insulator body formation and under physiological 
conditions. We propose a mechanism whereby these architectural proteins modulate 
3D genome organization through LLPS.

E. coli single-stranded-DNA binding protein (EcSSB) displays nearest-neighbor 
(NN) and non-nearest-neighbor (NNN)) cooperativity in binding ssDNA during 
genome maintenance. NNN cooperativity requires the intrinsically-disordered 
linkers (IDL) of the C-terminal tails. Potassium glutamate (KGlu), the primary 
E. coli salt, promotes NNN-cooperativity, while KCl inhibits it. We find that 
KGlu promotes compaction of a single polymeric SSB-coated ssDNA beyond what 
occurs in KCl, indicating a link of compaction to NNN-cooperativity. EcSSB also 
undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), inhibited by ssDNA binding. We 
find that LLPS, like NNN-cooperativity, is promoted by increasing [KGlu] in the 
physiological range, while increasing [KCl] and/or deletion of the IDL eliminate 
LLPS, indicating similar interactions in both processes. From quantitative 
determinations of interactions of KGlu and KCl with protein model compounds, we 
deduce that the opposing effects of KGlu and KCl on SSB LLPS and cooperativity 
arise from their opposite interactions with amide groups. KGlu interacts 
unfavorably with the backbone (especially Gly) and side chain amide groups of 
the IDL, promoting amide-amide interactions in LLPS and NNN-cooperativity. By 
contrast, KCl interacts favorably with these amide groups and therefore inhibits 
LLPS and NNN-cooperativity. These results highlight the importance of salt 
interactions in regulating the propensity of proteins to undergo LLPS.

Macromolecular crowding has a profound impact on the conformational dynamics and 
intermolecular interactions of biological macromolecules. In this context, the 
role of inert synthetic crowders in the protein-protein interactions of globular 
proteins is poorly understood. Here, using native human serum albumin (HSA) 
under physiological conditions, we show that macromolecular crowding induces 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) via liquid-like membrane-less droplet 
formation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Circular dichroism 
measurements reveal significant alteration in the secondary structure of HSA 
inside the droplet during aging. In contrast, at a high protein concentration, a 
liquid-to-solid-like phase transition has been observed upon maturation. Our 
findings reveal that the LLPS of HSA is mainly driven by enthalpically 
controlled intermolecular protein-protein interactions via hydrophobic contacts 
involving aromatic and/or nonaromatic residues. Moreover, modulation of LLPS of 
HSA has been demonstrated upon denaturation and ligand binding. This study 
highlights the importance of soft protein-protein interactions of globular 
proteins in a crowded cellular environment in driving the LLPS.

To gain more information about the nature of Birnaviridae virus factories (VFs), 
we used a recombinant infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) expressing 
split-GFP11 tagged to the polymerase (VP1) that we have previously shown is a 
marker for VFs in infected cells expressing GFP1-10. We found that VFs 
colocalized with 5-ethynyl uridine in the presence of actinomycin, demonstrating 
they contained newly synthesized viral RNA, and VFs were visible in infected 
cells that were fixed and permeabilized with digitonin, demonstrating that they 
were not membrane bound. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) a 
region of interest within the VFs occurred rapidly, recovering from 
approximately 25% to 87% the original intensity over 146 s, and VFs were 
dissolved by 1,6-hexanediol treatment, demonstrating they showed properties 
consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation. There was a lower colocalization 
of the VF GFP signal with the capsid protein VP2 (Manders' coefficient [MC] 
0.6), compared to VP3 (MC, 0.9), which prompted us to investigate the VF 
ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In infected cells, 
paracrystalline arrays (PAs) of virions were observed in the cytoplasm, as well 
as discrete electron dense regions. Using correlative light and electron 
microscopy (CLEM), we observed that the electron dense regions correlated with 
the GFP signal of the VFs, which were distinct from the PAs. In summary, 
Birnaviridae VFs contain newly synthesized viral RNA, are not bound by a 
membrane, show properties consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation, and 
are distinct from the PAs observed by TEM. IMPORTANCE Members of the 
Birnaviridae infect birds, fish and insects, and are responsible for diseases of 
significant economic importance to the poultry industry and aquaculture. Despite 
their importance, how they replicate in cells remains poorly understood. Here, 
we show that the Birnaviridae virus factories are not membrane bound, 
demonstrate properties consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation, and are 
distinct from the paracrystalline arrays of virions observed by transmission 
electron microscopy, enhancing our fundamental knowledge of virus replication 
that could be used to develop strategies to control disease, or optimize their 
therapeutic application.

Tau is a naturally disordered microtubule associated protein which forms 
intraneuronal aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was reported that zinc interaction with tau protein 
can trigger its aggregation. Recently we identified three zinc binding sites 
located in the N-terminal part, repeat region and the C-terminal part of tau. 
Here we characterized zinc binding to each of the three sites using isothermal 
titration calorimetry (ITC) and determined the impact of each site on 
aggregation using dynamic light scattering (DLS) assays. First, we confirmed the 
presence of three zinc binding sites on tau and determined the thermodynamic 
parameters of binding of zinc to these sites. We found a high-affinity zinc 
binding site located in the repeat region of tau and two N- and C-terminus 
binding sites with a lower binding constant for zinc. Second, we showed that tau 
aggregation necessitates zinc binding to the high affinity site in the R2R3 
region, while LLPS necessitates zinc binding to any two binding sites. With 
regard to the role of zinc ions in the aggregation of proteins in 
neurodegenerative diseases, these findings bring new insights to the 
understanding of the aggregation mechanism of tau protein induced by zinc.

Hsp70 is a key molecular chaperone in the protein quality control system to 
safeguard protein homeostasis in cells. Previous studies have shown that Hsp70 
chaperones TDP-43, a pathogenic protein associated with amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS), in nuclear bodies and prevents it from the pathological 
aggregation. In this work, we report that Hsp70 undergoes liquid-liquid phase 
separation, chaperones FUS, another ALS-linked pathogenic protein, in stress 
granules (SGs), and prevents condensed FUS from amyloid aggregation. Knock-down 
of Hsp70 does not influence SG assembly but results in the liquid-to-solid 
transition in SGs. NMR experiments further reveal Hsp70 predominantly uses its 
C-terminal substrate-binding domain to interact with the low complexity domain 
of FUS, which represents a mechanism distinct from that interacting with TDP-43. 
These findings suggest that Hsp70 is widely involved in chaperoning the 
physiological dynamics of various membrane-less organelles and adopts different 
mechanisms to prevent the pathological aggregation of different proteins.

Employing X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, we measure the kinetics and 
dynamics of a pressure-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a 
water-lysozyme solution. Scattering invariants and kinetic information provide 
evidence that the system reaches the phase boundary upon pressure-induced LLPS 
with no sign of arrest. The coarsening slows down with increasing quench depths. 
The g2 functions display a two-step decay with a gradually increasing 
nonergodicity parameter typical for gelation. We observe fast superdiffusive (γ 
≥ 3/2) and slow subdiffusive (γ < 0.6) motion associated with fast viscoelastic 
fluctuations of the network and a slow viscous coarsening process, respectively. 
The dynamics age linearly with time τ ∝ tw, and we observe the onset of 
viscoelastic relaxation for deeper quenches. Our results suggest that the 
protein solution gels upon reaching the phase boundary.

proteins and RNA molecules. We here demonstrate that N6-methyladenosine 
(m6A)-modified RNA is widespread in establishing diverse plant cell condensates. 
Several m6A-reader proteins contain putative prion-like domains, and the

The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biomolecules is a phenomenon which 
is nowadays recognized as the driving force for the biogenesis of numerous 
functional membraneless organelles and cellular bodies. The interplay between 
the protein primary sequence and phase separation remains poorly understood, 
despite intensive research. To uncover the sequence-encoded signals of protein 
capable of undergoing LLPS, we developed a novel web platform named BIAPSS 
(Bioinformatics Analysis of LLPS Sequences). This web server provides on-the-fly 
analysis, visualization, and interpretation of the physicochemical and 
structural features for the superset of curated LLPS proteins.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) acts as an important biological phenomenon 
in membraneless organelle formation. These phase-separated bodies can also act 
as nucleation centers for disease-associated amyloid formation. Fluorescence 
recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a crucial technique to analyze the 
material property (liquid or solid) of protein LLPS. On the other hand, Förster 
resonance energy transfer (FRET) is used to understand the domain-specific 
involvement (intermolecular interactions) of protein molecules inside the 
phase-separated droplets. In this protocol, we delineate mechanisms of 
liquid-to-solid transition of α-synuclein LLPS by using in vitro and in cell 
FRAP as well as in vitro FRET techniques.

The transition between the native and amyloid states of proteins can proceed via 
a deposition pathway via oligomeric intermediates or via a condensation pathway 
involving liquid droplet intermediates generated through liquid-liquid phase 
separation. While several computational methods are available to perform 
sequence-based predictions of the propensity of proteins to aggregate via the 
deposition pathway, much less is known about the physico-chemical principles 
that underlie aggregation within condensates. Here we investigate the sequence 
determinants of aggregation via the condensation pathway, and identify three 
relevant features: droplet-promoting propensity, aggregation-promoting 
propensity and multimodal interactions quantified by the binding mode entropy. 
By using this approach, we show that it is possible to predict 
aggregation-promoting mutations in droplet-forming proteins associated with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This analysis provides insights into the 
amino acid code for the conversion of proteins between liquid-like and 
solid-like condensates.

Uncontrolled assembly/disassembly of physiologically formed liquid condensates 
is linked to irreversible aggregation. Hence, the quest for understanding 
protein-misfolding disease mechanism might lie in the studies of protein:nucleic 
acid coacervation. Several proteins with intrinsically disordered regions as 
well as nucleic acids undergo phase separation in the cellular context, and this 
process is key to physiological signaling and is related to pathologies. Phase 
separation is reproducible in vitro by mixing the target recombinant protein 
with specific nucleic acids at various stoichiometric ratios and then examined 
by microscopy and nanotracking methods presented herein. We describe protocols 
to qualitatively assess hallmarks of protein-rich condensates, characterize 
their structure using intrinsic and extrinsic dyes, quantify them, and analyze 
their morphology over time. Analysis by nanoparticle tracking provides 
information on the concentration and diameter of high-order protein oligomers 
formed in the presence of nucleic acid. Using the model protein (globular domain 
of recombinant murine PrP) and DNA aptamers (high-affinity oligonucleotides with 
25 nucleotides in length), we provide examples of a systematic screening of 
liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro.

Viral factories are intracellular microcompartments formed by mammalian viruses 
in their host cells, and contain necessary machinery for viral genome 
replication, capsid assembly, and maturation, thus serving as "factories" for 
formation of new viral particles. Recent evidence suggests that these 
compartments are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of viral 
proteins and nucleic acids and present dynamic properties. In this work, 
inspired by the remarkable functionalities of viral factories, dynamic 
compartments that are formed by complexation between a minimalistic, disordered 
peptide and RNA are designed. By systematic studies using sequence variants it 
is shown that the material properties of the compartments can be modulated by 
changes to the peptide sequence, at the single amino acid level. Moreover, by 
taking this approach to the next step, liquid compartments with light-induced 
tunable dynamics are developed. The results demonstrate that the material 
properties of liquid droplets can be temporally regulated by increasing peptide 
polarity and charge, and that these changes can be further utilized for 
controlled partitioning and release of payloads from the compartments.

Aluminosilicates (AS) are ubiquitous in ceramics, geology, and planetary 
science, and their glassy forms underpin vital technologies used in displays, 
waveguides, and lasers. In spite of this, the nonequilibrium behavior of the 
prototypical AS compound, mullite (40SiO2-60Al2O3, or AS60), is not well 
understood. By deeply supercooling mullite-composition liquid via aerodynamic 
levitation, we observe metastable liquid-liquid unmixing that yields a 
transparent two-phase glass, comprising a nanoscale mixture of AS7 and AS62. 
Extrapolations from X-ray scattering measurements show the AS7 phase is similar 
to vitreous SiO2 with a few Al species substituted for Si. The AS62 phase is 
built from a highly polymerized network of 4-, 5-, and 6-coordinated AlOx 
polyhedra. Polymerization of the AS62 network and the composite morphology 
provide essential mechanisms for toughening the glass.

MOTIVATION: Proteins involved in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and 
membraneless organelles (MLOs) are recognized to be decisive for many biological 
processes and also responsible for several diseases. The recent explosion of 
research in the area still lacks tools for the analysis and data integration 
among different repositories. Currently, there is not a comprehensive and 
dedicated database that collects all disease-related variations in combination 
with the protein location, biological role in the MLO, and all the metadata 
available for each protein and disease. Disease-related protein variants and 
additional features are dispersed and the user has to navigate many databases, 
with a different focus, formats, and often not user friendly.
RESULTS: We present DisPhaseDB, a database dedicated to disease-related variants 
of liquid-liquid phase separation proteins. It integrates 10 databases, contains 
5,741 proteins, 1,660,059 variants, and 4,051 disease terms. It also offers 
intuitive navigation and an informative display. It constitutes a pivotal 
starting point for further analysis, encouraging the development of new 
computational tools.The database is freely available at

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) 
in proteins can drive the formation of membraneless compartments in cells. 
Phase-separated structures enrich for specific partner proteins and exclude 
others. Previously, we showed that the IDRs of metazoan DNA replication 
initiators drive DNA-dependent phase separation in vitro and chromosome binding 
in vivo, and that initiator condensates selectively recruit replication-specific 
partner proteins (Parker et al., 2019). How initiator IDRs facilitate LLPS and 
maintain compositional specificity is unknown. Here, using Drosophila 
melanogaster (Dm) Cdt1 as a model initiation factor, we show that phase 
separation results from a synergy between electrostatic DNA-bridging 
interactions and hydrophobic inter-IDR contacts. Both sets of interactions 
depend on sequence composition (but not sequence order), are resistant to 
1,6-hexanediol, and do not depend on aromaticity. These findings demonstrate 
that distinct sets of interactions drive condensate formation and specificity 
across different phase-separating systems and advance efforts to predict IDR 
LLPS propensity and partner selection a priori.

Mussels (Mytilus edulis) adhere to hard surfaces in intertidal marine habitats 
with a porous underwater glue called the byssus plaque. The plaque is an 
established role model for bioinspired underwater glues and comprises at least 
six proteins, most of which are highly cationic and enriched in the 
post-translationally modified amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). 
While much is known about the chemistry of plaque adhesion, less is understood 
about the natural plaque formation process. Here, we investigated plaque 
structure and formation using 3D electron microscopic imaging, revealing that 
micro- and nanopores form spontaneously during secretion of protein-filled 
secretory vesicles. To better understand this process, we developed a method to 
purify intact secretory vesicles for in vitro assembly studies. We discovered 
that each vesicle contains a sulfate-associated fluid condensate consisting of 
∼9 histidine- and/or DOPA-rich proteins, which are presumably the required 
ingredients for building a plaque. Rupturing vesicles under specific buffering 
conditions relevant for natural assembly led to controlled multiphase 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of different proteins, resulting in 
formation of a continuous phase with coexisting droplets. Rapid coarsening of 
the droplet phase was arrested through pH-dependent cross-linking of the 
continuous phase, producing native-like solid porous "microplaques" with droplet 
proteins remaining as fluid condensates within the pores. Results indicate that 
histidine deprotonation and sulfates figure prominently in condensate 
cross-linking. Distilled concepts suggest that combining phase separation with 
tunable cross-linking kinetics could be effective for microfabricating 
hierarchically porous materials via self-assembly.

Viruses rely on the reprogramming of cellular processes to enable efficient 
viral replication; this often requires subcompartmentalization within the host 
cell. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a fundamental 
principle to organize and subdivide cellular processes, and plays an important 
role in viral life cycles. Despite substantial advances in the field, 
elucidating the exact organization and function of these organelles remains a 
major challenge. In this review, we summarize the biochemical basis of 
condensate formation, the role of LLPS during viral infection, and interplay of 
LLPS with innate immune responses. Finally, we discuss possible strategies and 
molecules to modulate LLPS during viral infections.

Biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) are 
involved in a myriad of critical cellular functions and debilitating 
neurodegenerative diseases. Elucidating the role of intrinsic disorder and 
conformational heterogeneity of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions 
(IDPs/IDRs) in these phase-separated membrane-less organelles is crucial to 
understanding the mechanism of formation and regulation of biomolecular 
condensates. Here we introduce a unique single-droplet surface-enhanced Raman 
scattering (SERS) methodology that utilizes surface-engineered, plasmonic, metal 
nanoparticles to unveil the inner workings of mesoscopic liquid droplets of 
Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) in the absence and presence of RNA. These highly 
sensitive measurements offer unprecedented sensitivity to capture the crucial 
interactions, conformational heterogeneity, and structural distributions within 
the condensed phase in a droplet-by-droplet manner. Such an ultra-sensitive 
single-droplet vibrational methodology can serve as a potent tool to decipher 
the key molecular drivers of biological phase transitions of a wide range of 
biomolecular condensates involved in physiology and disease.

The facts that many proteins with crucial biological functions do not have 
unique structures and that many biological processes are compartmentalized into 
the liquid-like biomolecular condensates, which are formed via liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) and are not surrounded by the membrane, are 
revolutionizing the modern biology. These phenomena are interlinked, as the 
presence of intrinsic disorder represents an important requirement for a protein 
to undergo LLPS that drives biogenesis of numerous membrane-less organelles 
(MLOs). Therefore, one can consider these phenomena as crucial constituents of a 
new IDP-LLPS-MLO field. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), 
LLPS, and MLOs represent a clear link between molecular and cellular biology and 
soft matter and condensed soft matter physics. Both IDP and LLPS/MLO fields are 
undergoing explosive development and generate the ever-increasing mountain of 
crucial data. These new data provide answers to so many long-standing questions 
that it is difficult to imagine that in the very recent past, protein scientists 
and cellular biologists operated without taking these revolutionary concepts 
into account. The goal of this essay is not to deliver a comprehensive review of 
the IDP-LLPS-MLO field but to provide a brief and rather subjective outline of 
some of the recent developments in these exciting fields.

Accumulating evidence indicates that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is 
the basis of the formation of membrane-less compartments in cells. This 
biomolecular condensate represented by phase separation may influence 
epigenetics in cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subpopulation of cancer cells 
responding to the initiation, maintenance, metastasis, and therapy resistance of 
cancer. Understanding the underlying biophysical principles and the specific 
characteristics of biocondensates would provide insights into the precise 
blocking of potential tumor targets, thereby fundamentally curbing tumor 
occurrence, recurrence and metastasis. In this review, we summarized the key 
phenomenon and experimental detection of phase separation and the possibility of 
regulating the stemness of CSCs through phase separation. We believe that the 
mechanism of phase separation in CSCs will open up new avenues for the mystery 
of tumor formation, and modulating phase separation will be a great strategy for 
CSC-targeted tumor therapy.

Large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) are larger in volume than synaptic vesicles, 
and are filled with multiple neuropeptides, hormones, and neurotransmitters that 
participate in various physiological processes. However, little is known about 
the mechanism determining the size of LDCVs. Here, it is reported that 
secretogranin II (SgII), a vesicle matrix protein, contributes to LDCV size 
regulation through its liquid-liquid phase separation in neuroendocrine cells. 
First, SgII undergoes pH-dependent polymerization and the polymerized SgII forms 
phase droplets with Ca2+ in vitro and in vivo. Further, the Ca2+ -induced SgII 
droplets recruit reconstituted bio-lipids, mimicking the LDCVs biogenesis. In 
addition, SgII knockdown leads to significant decrease of the quantal 
neurotransmitter release by affecting LDCV size, which is differently rescued by 
SgII truncations with different degrees of phase separation. In conclusion, it 
is shown that SgII is a unique intravesicular matrix protein undergoing 
liquid-liquid phase separation, and present novel insights into how SgII 
determines LDCV size and the quantal neurotransmitter release.

The aggregation and misfolding of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein 
tau is closely linked to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and several other 
neurodegenerative diseases. Recent evidence suggest that tau undergoes 
liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro and forms or associates with 
membrane-less organelles in cells. Biomolecular condensation driven by phase 
separation can influence the biological activities of tau including its ability 
to polymerize tubulin into microtubules. In addition, the high concentrations 
that tau can reach in biomolecular condensates provide a mechanism to promote 
its aggregation and the formation of amyloid fibrils potentially contributing to 
the pathology of different tauopathies. Here, the authors discuss the role of 
tau phase separation in physiology and disease.

The nuclear envelope (NE) is a bilayer membrane that separates and physically 
isolates the genetic material from the cytoplasm. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) 
are cylindrical structures embedded in the NE and remain the sole channel of 
communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The interior of NPCs 
contains densely packed intrinsically disordered FG-nucleoporins (FG-Nups), 
consequently forming a permeability barrier. This barrier facilitates the 
selection and specificity of the cargoes that are imported, exported, or 
shuttled through the NPCs. Recent studies have revealed that FG-Nups undergo the 
process of liquid-liquid phase separation into liquid droplets. Moreover, these 
liquid droplets mimic the permeability barrier observed in the interior of NPCs. 
This review highlights the phase separation of FG-Nups occurring inside the NPCs 
rooted in the NE. We discuss the phase separation of FG-Nups and compare the 
different aspects contributing to their phase separation. Furthermore, several 
diseases caused by the aberrant phase separation of the proteins are examined 
with respect to NEs. By understanding the fundamental process of phase 
separation at the nuclear membrane, the review seeks to explore the parameters 
influencing this phenomenon as well as its importance, ultimately paving the way 
for better research on the structure-function relationship of biomolecular 
condensates.

Methyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3) plays critical roles in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) progression, however, the mechanism of abnormal overexpression of 
METTL3 in AML remain elusive. In the current study, we uncovered that Yin Yang 1 
(YY1) binds to the promoter region of METTL3 as a transcription factor and 
promotes its expression, which in turn enhances the proliferation of AML cells. 
Mechanistically, YY1 binds to HDAC1/3 and regulates METTL3 expression in a 
moderate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) manner. After mutation of the 
HDAC-binding site of YY1 or HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) treatment, YY1 was separated 
from HDAC1/3, which resulted in an excessive LLPS state, thereby inhibiting the 
expression of METTL3 and the proliferation of AML cells. In conclusion, our 
study clarified the regulatory mechanism of the abnormal expression of METTL3 in 
AML, revealed the precise "Yin-Yang" regulatory mechanism of YY1 from the 
perspective of LLPS degree, and provided new ideas for the precise diagnosis and 
treatment of AML.

Maintaining genomic integrity and stability is particularly important for stem 
cells, which are at the top of the cell lineage origin. Here, we discovered that 
the plant-specific histone methyltransferase SUVR2 maintains the genome 
integrity of the root tip stem cells through chromatin remodeling and 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) when facing DNA double-strand breaks 
(DSBs). The histone methyltransferase SUVR2 (MtSUVR2) has histone 
methyltransferase activity and catalyzes the conversion of histone H3 lysine 9 
monomethylation (H3K9me1) to H3K9me2/3 in vitro and in Medicago truncatula. 
Under DNA damage, the proportion of heterochromatin decreased and the level of 
DSB damage marker γ-H2AX increased in suvr2 mutants, indicating that MtSUVR2 
promotes the compaction of the chromatin structure through H3K9 methylation 
modification to protect DNA from damage. Interestingly, MtSUVR2 was induced by 
DSBs to phase separate and form droplets to localize at the damage sites, and 
this was confirmed by immunofluorescence and fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching experiments. The IDR1 and low-complexity domain regions of 
MtSUVR2 determined its phase separation in the nucleus, whereas the IDR2 region 
determined the interaction with the homologous recombinase MtRAD51. Furthermore, 
we found that MtSUVR2 drove the phase separation of MtRAD51 to form "DNA repair 
bodies," which could enhance the stability of MtRAD51 proteins to facilitate 
error-free homologous recombination repair of stem cells. Taken together, our 
study reveals that chromatin remodeling-associated proteins participate in DNA 
repair through LLPS.

Phase separation is a ubiquitous process and finds applications in a variety of 
biological, organic, and inorganic systems. Nature has evolved the ability to 
control phase separation to both regulate cellular processes and make composite 
materials with outstanding mechanical and optical properties. Striking examples 
of the latter are the vibrant blue and green feathers of many bird species, 
which are thought to result from an exquisite control of the size and spatial 
correlations of their phase-separated microstructures. By contrast, it is much 
harder for material scientists to arrest and control phase separation in 
synthetic materials with such a high level of precision at these length scales. 
In this Perspective, we briefly review some established methods to control 
liquid-liquid phase separation processes and then highlight the emergence of a 
promising arrest method based on phase separation in an elastic polymer network. 
Finally, we discuss upcoming challenges and opportunities for fabricating 
microstructured materials via mechanically controlled phase separation.

The process of phase separation allows for the establishment and formation of 
subcompartmentalized structures, thus enabling cells to perform simultaneous 
processes with precise organization and low energy requirements. Chemical 
modifications of proteins, RNA, and lipids alter the molecular environment 
facilitating enzymatic reactions at higher concentrations in particular regions 
of the cell. In this review, we discuss the nucleolus as an example of the 
establishment, dynamics, and maintenance of a membraneless organelle with a high 
level of organization.

Heterochromatin is the highly compacted form of chromatin with various 
condensation levels hallmarked by high DNA methylation. MeCP2 is mostly known as 
a DNA methylation reader but has also been reported as a heterochromatin 
organizer. Here, we combine liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) analysis and 
single-molecule tracking with quantification of local MeCP2 concentrations in 
vitro and in vivo to explore the mechanism of MeCP2-driven heterochromatin 
organization and dynamics. We show that MeCP2 alone forms liquid-like spherical 
droplets via multivalent electrostatic interactions and with isotropic mobility. 
Crowded environments and DNA promote MeCP2 LLPS and slow down MeCP2 mobility. 
DNA methylation, however, restricts the growth of heterochromatin compartments 
correlating with immobilization of MeCP2. Furthermore, MeCP2 self-interaction is 
required for LLPS and is disrupted by Rett syndrome mutations. In summary, we 
are able to model the heterochromatin compartmentalization as well as MeCP2 
concentration and heterogeneous motion in the minimal in vitro system.

A temperature-induced counter-current homogenous liquid-liquid extraction 
procedure performed in a burette has been proposed for the isolation of 
aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 from various fruit chip samples. In this method, a 
homogenous solution of deionized water and cyclohexylamine is added to the solid 
sample and the resulted mixture is vortexed. In the following, the liquid phase 
is taken and passed through the burette filled with a mixture of calcium oxide 
(as a phase separation agent) and sand (to avoid clumping the calcium oxide). By 
doing so, the temperature of the solution is increased by hydration of calcium 
oxide and consequently, the homogenous state is broken and the aflatoxins are 
migrated into the resulted tiny droplets of cyclohexylamine. This phase is 
collected on the top of the solution owing to its low density with respect to an 
aqueous solution. Numerous parameters which can affect the efficiency of the 
suggested approach were evaluated and under the best situations, great 
repeatability, low limits of determination and quantification, and high 
extraction recoveries were acquired. In the end, the suggested approach was 
employed for the quantification of the selected aflatoxins in various fruit 
chips samples marketed in Tabriz City, Iran.

The cell nucleus can be thought of as a complex, dynamic, living material, which 
functions to organize and protect the genome and coordinate gene expression. 
These functions are achieved via intricate mechanical and biochemical 
interactions among its myriad components, including the nuclear lamina, nuclear 
bodies, and the chromatin itself. While the biophysical organization of the 
nuclear lamina and chromatin have been thoroughly studied, the concept that 
liquid-liquid phase separation and related phase transitions play a role in 
establishing nuclear structure has emerged only recently. Phase transitions are 
likely to be intimately coupled to the mechanobiology of structural elements in 
the nucleus, but their interplay with one another is still not understood. Here, 
we review recent developments on the role of phase separation and mechanics in 
nuclear organization and discuss the functional implications in cell physiology 
and disease states.

Postoperative barriers have been widely used to prevent adhesions. However, 
there are currently few barriers that satisfy clinical requirements, such as 
tissue adhesion, operability, and biocompatibility. Inspired by the adhesion 
system of living organisms, we report a liquid-liquid phase-separated hydrogel 
as a single-syringe hotmelt-type postoperative barrier. Mixing polyethylene 
glycol with gelatin formed liquid-liquid phase-separated hydrogels through 
segregative liquid-liquid phase separation. Incorporation of a liquid-liquid 
phase-separated system into gelatin can enhance the sol-gel transition 
temperature to give a hotmelt-adhesive property to hydrogels. Hotmelt-adhesive 
hydrogels became a sol phase and cohered into tissue gaps when warmed and 
solidified at body temperature to adhere to soft tissues. The hydrogels 
exhibited tissue adhesion to large intestine tissues and showed improved 
mechanical strength, gelation time, and shear-thinning properties. In rat 
cecum-abdominal adhesion models, it was confirmed that the resulting hydrogels 
prevented abdominal adhesion and did not prevent tissue regeneration. 
Hotmelt-adhesive hydrogels with high tissue adhesive properties, operability, 
and biocompatibility have enormous potential as barriers to prevent 
postoperative complications.

Coacervation plays an important role in the molecular assembly towards soft 
materials with a diversity of function (e. g., underwater adhesives of mussels 
and membraneless organelles). Coacervation is observed when one homogenous 
solution spontaneously separates into two immiscible liquid phases of low and 
high solute concentration, also known as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), 
which enables spatiotemporally local concentration of specific molecules. LLPS 
is a common physical phenomenon in aqueous solutions of polyelectrolytes, 
surfactants and biomolecules, which has been extensively explored for 
applications in the fields of environmental remediation, cosmetic formulation, 
protein purification, extractive fermentation and pharmaceutical 
microencapsulation. This review summarizes the development of LLPS with low 
molecular weight amphiphiles to construct simple and complex coacervates using 
conventional surfactants and novel amphiphiles such as azobenzene-derivatives 
and peptides. We also highlight the applications of these amphiphile coacervates 
in the extraction of biomolecules, construction of protocell models and drug 
delivery.

[No authors listed]

Deacetylation of specific lysine residues in the DNA-binding domain of the 
transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 by SIRT1 is necessary for liquid–liquid 
phase separation and transactivation of type I interferons. SIRT1 agonists 
partially restored the impaired innate immune responses in senescent cells and 
aged mice, suggestive of a possible strategy for preventing innate 
immunosenescence.

The organization of the postsynaptic density (PSD), a protein-dense 
semi-membraneless organelle, is mediated by numerous specific protein-protein 
interactions (PPIs) which constitute a functional postsynapse. The PSD protein 
95 (PSD-95) interacts with a manifold of proteins, including the C-terminal of 
transmembrane AMPA receptor (AMPAR) regulatory proteins (TARPs). Here, we 
uncover the minimal essential peptide responsible for the Stargazin 
(TARP-γ2)-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) formation of PSD-95 and 
other key protein constituents of the PSD. Furthermore, we find that 
pharmacological inhibitors of PSD-95 can facilitate the formation of LLPS. We 
found that in some cases LLPS formation is dependent on multivalent 
interactions, while in other cases short, highly charged peptides are sufficient 
to promote LLPS in complex systems. This study offers a new perspective on 
PSD-95 interactions and their role in LLPS formation, while also considering the 
role of affinity over multivalency in LLPS systems.

Many members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of ubiquitin ligases localize 
in spherical, membrane-free structures collectively referred to as cytoplasmic 
bodies (CBs) in a concentration-dependent manner. These CBs may function as 
aggresome precursors or storage compartments that segregate potentially harmful 
excess TRIM molecules from the cytosolic milieu. However, the manner in which 
TRIM proteins accumulate into CBs is unclear. In the present study, using 
TRIM32, TRIM5α and TRIM63 as examples, we demonstrated that CBs are in a liquid 
droplet state, resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This 
finding is based on criteria that defines phase-separated structures, such as 
recovery after photobleaching, sensitivity to hexanediol, and the ability to 
undergo fusion. CB droplets, which contain cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-fused 
TRIM32, were purified from HEK293 cells using a fluorescence-activated cell 
sorter and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. We found that in addition to TRIM32, these 
droplets contain a variety of endogenous proteins and enzymes including 
ubiquitin. Localization of ubiquitin within CBs was further verified by 
fluorescence microscopy. We also found that the activation of the intracellular 
ubiquitination cascade promotes the assembly of TRIM32 molecules into CBs, 
whereas inhibition causes suppression. Regulation is dependent on the intrinsic 
E3 ligase activity of TRIM32. Similar regulation by ubiquitination on the TRIM 
assembly was also observed with TRIM5α and TRIM63. Our findings provide a novel 
mechanical basis for the organization of CBs that couples compartmentalization 
through LLPS with ubiquitination.

Gene activation by mammalian transcription factors (TFs) requires multivalent 
interactions of their low-complexity domains (LCDs), but how such interactions 
regulate transcription remains unclear. It has been proposed that extensive 
LCD-LCD interactions culminating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TFs 
is the dominant mechanism underlying transactivation. Here, we investigated how 
tuning the amount and localization of LCD-LCD interactions in vivo affects 
transcription of endogenous human genes. Quantitative single-cell and 
single-molecule imaging reveals that the oncogenic TF EWS::FLI1 requires a 
narrow optimum of LCD-LCD interactions to activate its target genes associated 
with GGAA microsatellites. Increasing LCD-LCD interactions toward putative LLPS 
represses transcription of these genes in patient-derived cells. Likewise, 
ectopically creating LCD-LCD interactions to sequester EWS::FLI1 into a 
well-documented LLPS compartment, the nucleolus, inhibits EWS::FLI1-driven 
transcription and oncogenic transformation. Our findings show how altering the 
balance of LCD-LCD interactions can influence transcriptional regulation and 
suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting disease-causing TFs.

SUMMARY: Emerging evidences have suggested that liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) of proteins plays a vital role both in a wide range of biological 
processes and in related diseases. Whether a protein undergoes phase separation 
not only is determined by the chemical and physical properties of biomolecule 
themselves, but also is regulated by environmental conditions such as 
temperature, ionic strength, pH, as well as volume excluded by other 
macromolecules. A web accessible database LLPSDB was developed recently by our 
group, in which all the proteins involved in LLPS in vitro as well as 
corresponding experimental conditions were curated comprehensively from 
published literatures. With the rapid increase of investigations in biomolecular 
LLPS and growing popularity of LLPSDB, we updated the database, and developed a 
new version LLPSDB v2.0. In comparison of the previously released version, more 
than double contents of data are curated, and a new class 'Ambiguous system' is 
added. In addition, the web interface is improved, such as that users can search 
the database by selecting option 'phase separation status' alone or combined 
with other options. We anticipate that this updated database will serve as a 
more comprehensive and helpful resource for users.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: LLPSDB v2.0 is freely available at: 
http://bio-comp.org.cn/llpsdbv2.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics

Understanding the characteristics of cancer cells is essential for the 
development of improved diagnosis and therapeutics. From a gene regulation 
perspective, the super-enhancer concept has been introduced to systematically 
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the identities of various cell 
types and has been extended to the analysis of cancer cells and cancer genome 
alterations. In addition, several characteristic features of super-enhancers 
have led to the recognition of the link between gene regulation and biomolecular 
condensates, which is often mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation. Several 
lines of evidence have suggested molecular and biophysical principles and their 
alterations in cancer cells, which are particularly associated with gene 
regulation and cell signaling (" transcriptional" and "signaling" condensates). 
These findings collectively suggest that the modification of biomolecular 
condensates represents an important mechanism by which cancer cells acquire 
various cancer hallmark traits and establish functional innovation for cancer 
initiation and progression. The condensate model also provides the molecular 
basis of the vulnerability of cancer cells to transcriptional perturbation and 
further suggests the possibility of therapeutic targeting of condensates. This

Fused in sarcoma (FUS), a nuclear RNA binding protein, can not only undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form dynamic biomolecular condensates 
but also aggregate into solid amyloid fibrils which are associated with the 
pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration 
diseases. Phosphorylation in the FUS low-complexity domain (FUS-LC) inhibits FUS 
LLPS and aggregation. However, it remains largely elusive what are the 
underlying atomistic mechanisms of this inhibitory effect and whether 
phosphorylation can disrupt preformed FUS fibrils, reversing the FUS gel/solid 
phase toward the liquid phase. Herein, we systematically investigate the impacts 
of phosphorylation on the conformational ensemble of the FUS37-97 monomer and 
dimer and the structure of the FUS37-97 fibril by performing extensive all-atom 
molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations reveal three key findings: (1) 
phosphorylation shifts the conformations of FUS37-97 from the β-rich, 
fibril-competent state toward a helix-rich, fibril-incompetent state; (2) 
phosphorylation significantly weakens protein-protein interactions and enhances 
protein-water interactions, which disfavor FUS-LC LLPS as well as aggregation 
and facilitate the dissolution of the preformed FUS-LC fibril; and (3) the 
FUS37-97 peptide displays a high β-strand probability in the region spanning 
residues 52-67, and phosphorylation at S54 and S61 residues located in this 
region is crucial for the disruption of LLPS and aggregation of FUS-LC. This 
study may pave the way for ameliorating phase-separation-related pathologies via 
site-specific phosphorylation.

Membrane-enclosed organelle compartmentalization is not the only way by which 
cell processes are spatially organized. Phase separation is emerging as a new 
driver in the organization of membrane-less compartments and biological 
processes. Liquid-liquid phase separation has been indicated as a new way to 
control the kinetics of molecular reactions and is based on weak multivalent 
interactions affecting the stoichiometry of the molecules involved. In the 
nucleus, liquid-liquid phase separation may represent an ancestral means of 
controlling genomic activity by forming discrete chromatin regions, regulating 
transcriptional activity, contributing to the assembly of DNA damage response 
foci, and controlling the organization of chromosomes. Liquid-liquid phase 
separation also contributes to chromatin function through its role in the 
reorganization of the nuclear periphery in the post-mitotic phase. Herein, we 
describe the basic principles regulating liquid-liquid phase separation, analyze 
examples of phase separation occurring in the nucleus, and dedicate attention to 
the implication of liquid-liquid phase separation in the reorganization of the 
nuclear periphery by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport 
(ESCRT) machinery. Although some caution is warranted, current scientific 
knowledge allows for the hypothesis that many factors and processes in the cell 
are yet to be discovered which are functionally associated with phase 
separation.

The formation of biomolecular condensates has emerged as a crucial player both 
in neuronal physiology and neurodegeneration. Phase separation of the 
Alzheimer's related protein tau into liquid condensates is facilitated by 
polyanions and is regulated by post-translational modifications. Given the 
central role of ubiquitination in proteostasis regulation and signaling, we 
investigated the behavior of monoubiquitinated tau during formation of 
condensates. We ubiquitinated the lysine-rich, four-repeat domain of tau either 
unspecifically via enzymatic conjugation or in a position-specific manner by 
semisynthesis. Ubiquitin conjugation at specific sites weakened multivalent 
tau/RNA interactions and disfavored tau/heparin condensation. Yet, heterogeneous 
ubiquitination was tolerated during phase separation and stabilized droplets 
against aggregation-linked dissolution. Thus, we demonstrated that cofactor 
chemistry and site of modification affect the mesoscopic and molecular 
signatures of ubiquitinated tau condensates. Our findings suggest that 
ubiquitination could influence the physiological states and pathological 
transformations of tau in cellular condensates.

Dynamic morphological changes of intracellular organelles are often regulated by 
protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation1-6. Phosphorylation modulates 
stereospecific interactions among structured proteins, but how it controls 
molecular interactions among unstructured proteins and regulates their 
macroscopic behaviours remains unknown. Here we determined the cell 
cycle-specific behaviour of Ki-67, which localizes to the nucleoli during 
interphase and relocates to the chromosome periphery during mitosis. Mitotic 
hyperphosphorylation of disordered repeat domains of Ki-67 generates alternating 
charge blocks in these domains and increases their propensity for liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS). A phosphomimetic sequence and the sequences with 
enhanced charge blockiness underwent strong LLPS in vitro and induced chromosome 
periphery formation in vivo. Conversely, mitotic hyperphosphorylation of NPM1 
diminished a charge block and suppressed LLPS, resulting in nucleolar 
dissolution. Cell cycle-specific phase separation can be modulated via 
phosphorylation by enhancing or reducing the charge blockiness of disordered 
regions, rather than by attaching phosphate groups to specific sites.

The upper critical solution temperature (UCST)-type liquid-liquid phase 
separation of imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium 
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([Cnmim][TFSI], where n represents the alkyl 
chain length of the cation, n = 6, 8, 10, and 12) binary solutions with 
formamide (FA) was examined as a function of temperature and the FA mole 
fraction xFA. The two-phase region (immiscible region) of the solutions is much 
larger and expands more with the increase in n, in comparison with the previous 
[Cnmim][TFSI]-1,4-dioxane (1,4-DIO) systems. An array of spectroscopic 
techniques, including 1H and 13C NMR and IR combined with molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations, was conducted on the present binary systems to clarify the 
microscopic interactions that contribute to the phase-separation mechanism. The 
hydrogen-bonding interactions of the imidazolium ring H atoms are more favorable 
with the O atoms of the FA molecules than with 1,4-DIO molecules, whereas the 
latter interact more favorably with the alkyl chain of the cation. Upon lowering 
the temperature, the FA molecules gradually self-aggregate through self-hydrogen 
bonding to form FA clusters. Concomitantly, clusters of ILs are formed via the 
electrostatic interaction between the counter ions and the dispersion force 
among the IL alkyl chains. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on 
the [C6mim][TFSI]-FA-d2 and [C8mim][TFSI]-FA-d2 systems revealed, similarly to 
[Cnmim][TFSI]-1,4-DIO systems, the crossover of the mechanism from the 3D-Ising 
mechanism around the UCST xFA to the mean-field mechanism at both sides of the 
mole fraction. Interestingly, the xFA range of the 3D-Ising mechanism for the FA 
systems is wider compared with the range of the 1,4-DIO systems. In this way, 
the self-hydrogen bonding among FA molecules most significantly governs the 
phase equilibria of the [Cnmim][TFSI]-FA systems.

Since liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins is governed by their 
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), it can be controlled by LLPS-regulators 
that bind to the IDRs. The artificial design of LLPS-regulators based on this 
mechanism can be leveraged in biological and therapeutic applications. However, 
the fabrication of artificial LLPS-regulators remains challenging. Peptides are 
promising candidates for artificial LLPS-regulators because of their ability to 
potentially bind to IDRs complementarily. In this study, we provide a rational 
peptide design methodology for targeting IDRs based on residue-residue contact 
energy obtained using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This methodology 
provides rational peptide sequences that function as LLPS regulators. The 
peptides designed with the MD-based contact energy showed dissociation constants 
of 35-280 nM for the N-terminal IDR of the tumor suppressor p53, which are 
significantly lower than the dissociation constants of peptides designed with 
the conventional 3D structure-based energy, demonstrating the validity of the 
present peptide design methodology. Importantly, all of the designed peptides 
enhanced p53 droplet formation. The droplet-forming peptides were converted to 
droplet-deforming peptides by fusing maltose-binding protein (a soluble tag) to 
the designed peptides. Thus, the present peptide design methodology for 
targeting IDRs is useful for regulating droplet formation.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is critical for assembling membraneless 
organelles (MLOs) such as nucleoli, P-bodies, and stress granules, which are 
involved in various physiological processes and pathological conditions. While 
the critical role of RNA in the formation and the maintenance of MLOs is 
increasingly appreciated, there is still a lack of specific resources for 
LLPS-related RNAs. Here, we presented RPS (http://rps.renlab.org), a 
comprehensive database of LLPS-related RNAs in 20 distinct biomolecular 
condensates from eukaryotes and viruses. Currently, RPS contains 21,613 
LLPS-related RNAs with three different evidence types, including 'Reviewed', 
'High-throughput' and 'Predicted'. RPS provides extensive annotations of 
LLPS-associated RNA properties, including sequence features, RNA structures, 
RNA-protein/RNA-RNA interactions, and RNA modifications. Moreover, RPS also 
provides comprehensive disease annotations to help users to explore the 
relationship between LLPS and disease. The user-friendly web interface of RPS 
allows users to access the data efficiently. In summary, we believe that RPS 
will serve as a valuable platform to study the role of RNA in LLPS and further 
improve our understanding of the biological functions of LLPS.

Many proteins perform their functions within membraneless organelles, where they 
form a liquid-like condensed state, also known as droplet state. The FuzDrop 
method predicts the probability of spontaneous liquid-liquid phase separation of 
proteins and provides a sequence-based score to identify the regions that 
promote this process. Furthermore, the FuzDrop method estimates the propensity 
of conversion of proteins to the amyloid state, and identifies aggregation 
hot-spots, which can drive the irreversible maturation of the liquid-like 
droplet state. These predictions can also identify mutations that can induce 
formation of amyloid aggregates, including those implicated in human diseases. 
To facilitate the interpretation of the predictions, the droplet-promoting and 
aggregation-promoting regions can be visualized on protein structures generated 
by AlphaFold. The FuzDrop server (https://fuzdrop.bio.unipd.it) thus offers 
insights into the complex behavior of proteins in their condensed states and 
facilitates the understanding of the functional relationships of proteins.

Insect cuticle is a fiber-reinforced composite material that consists of 
polysaccharide chitin fibers and a protein matrix. The molecular interactions 
between insect cuticle proteins and chitin that govern the assembly and 
evolution of cuticles are still not well understood. Herein, we report that 
Ostrinia furnacalis cuticular protein hypothetical-1 (OfCPH-1), a newly 
discovered and most abundant cuticular protein from Asian corn borer O. 
furnacalis, can form coacervates in the presence of chitosan. The 
OfCPH-1-chitosan coacervate microdroplets are initially liquid-like but become 
gel-like with increasing time or salt concentration. The liquid-to-gel 
transition is driven by hydrogen-bonding interactions, during which an induced 
β-sheet structure of OfCPH-1 is observed. Given the abundance of OfCPH-1 in the 
cuticle of O. furnacalis, this liquid-liquid phase separation process and its 
aging behavior could play critical roles in the formation of the cuticle.

Phase separation is one of the fundamental processes to compartmentalize 
biomolecules in living cells. RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) often scaffold 
biomolecular condensates formed through phase separation. We here present a 
statistical thermodynamics approach to investigate intracellular phase 
separation. We first present the statistical thermodynamic theory of the 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of two molecules (such as proteins and 
solvent molecules) and of a polymer solution (such as RNPs and solvent 
molecules). Condensates produced by LLPS show coarsening and/or coalescence to 
minimize their total surface area. In addition to the LLPS, there are other 
types of self-assembly, such as microphase separation, micellization, 
emulsification, and vesiculation, with which the growth of the assembly stops 
with optimal size and shape. We also describe a scaling theory of micelles of 
block copolymers, where their structures are analogous to the core-shell 
structure of paraspeckle nuclear bodies scaffolded by RNPs of NEAT1_2 long 
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These theories treat 
the self-assembly of polymers in the thermodynamic equilibrium, where their 
concentrations and compositions do not change with time. In contrast, RNPs are 
produced according to the transcription of RNAs and are degraded with time. We 
therefore take into account the dynamical aspect of the production of RNPs in an 
extension of the theory of the self-assembly of soft matter. Finally, we discuss 
the structure of paraspeckles as an example to demonstrate that an approach 
combining experiment and theory is powerful to investigate the mechanism of 
intracellular phase separation.

Cancer is a public health problem of great concern, and it is also one of the 
main causes of death in the world. Cancer is a disease characterized by 
dysregulation of diverse cellular processes, including avoiding growth 
inhibitory factors, avoiding immune damage and promoting metastasis, etc. 
However, the precise mechanism of tumorigenesis and tumor progression still 
needs to be further elucidated. Formations of liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) condensates are a common strategy for cells to achieve diverse functions, 
such as chromatin organization, signal transduction, DNA repair and 
transcriptional regulation, etc. The biomolecular aggregates formed by LLPS are 
mainly driven by multivalent weak interactions mediated by intrinsic disordered 
regions (IDRs) in proteins. In recent years, aberrant phase separations and 
transition have been reported to be related to the process of various diseases, 
such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Herein, we discussed recent 
findings that phase separation regulates tumor-related signaling pathways and 
thus contributes to tumor progression. We also reviewed some tumor 
virus-associated proteins to regulate the development of virus-associated tumors 
via phase separation. Finally, we discussed some possible strategies for 
treating tumors by targeting phase separation.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has received considerable attention in 
recent years for explaining the formation of cellular biomolecular condensates. 
The fluidity and the complexity of their components make molecular simulation 
approaches indispensable for gaining structural insights. Domain-resolution 
mesoscopic model simulations have been explored for cases in which condensates 
are formed by multivalent proteins with tandem domains. One problem with this 
approach is that interdomain pairwise interactions cannot regulate the valency 
of the binding domains. To overcome this problem, we propose a new potential, 
the stoichiometric interaction (SI) potential. First, we verified that the SI 
potential maintained the valency of the interacting domains for the test 
systems. We then examined a well-studied LLPS model system containing tandem 
repeats of SH3 domains and proline-rich motifs. We found that the SI potential 
alone cannot reproduce the phase diagram of LLPS quantitatively. We had to 
combine the SI and a pairwise interaction; the former and the latter represent 
the specific and nonspecific interactions, respectively. Biomolecular 
condensates with the mixed SI and pairwise interaction exhibited fluidity, 
whereas those with the pairwise interaction alone showed no detectable 
diffusion. We also compared the phase diagrams of the systems containing 
different numbers of tandem domains with those obtained from the experiments and 
found quantitative agreement in all but one case.

The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) forms ribonucleoprotein granules 
via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the cytoplasm. The phase separation 
of FUS accelerates aberrant liquid-solid phase separation and leads to the onset 
of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously found that FUS 
forms two types of liquid condensates in equilibrium, specifically LP-LLPS 
(i.e., normal type) and HP-LLPS (i.e., aberrant type), each with different 
partial molar volumes. However, it is unclear how liquid condensates are 
converted to the pathogenic solid phase. Here, we report a mechanism underlying 
the aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transition of FUS liquid condensates and the 
inhibition of this transition with small molecules. We found that the liquid 
condensate formed via HP-LLPS had greatly reduced dynamics, which is a common 
feature of aged wild-type FUS droplets and the droplet-like assembly of the ALS 
patient-type FUS variant. The longer FUS remained on the HP-LLPS, the harder it 
was to transform it into a mixed state (i.e., one-phase). These results indicate 
that liquid-to-solid phase transition, namely the aging of droplets, is 
accelerated with HP-LLPS. Interestingly, arginine suppressed the aging of 
droplets and HP-LLPS formation more strongly than LP-LLPS formation. These data 
indicate that the formation of HP-LLPS via the one-phase state or LP-LLPS is a 
pathway leading to irreversible solid aggregates. Dopamine and pyrocatechol also 
suppressed HP-LLPS formation. Our data highlight the potential of HP-LLPS to be 
used as a therapeutic target and arginine as a plausible drug candidate for 
ALS-causing FUS.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that undergoes 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), fibrillation, and forms insoluble 
intracellular Lewy bodies in neurons, which are the hallmark of Parkinson's 
Disease (PD). Neurotoxicity precedes the formation of aggregates and might be 
related to α-syn LLPS. The molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of 
LLPS are still elusive. To obtain structural insights into α-syn upon LLPS, we 
take advantage of cross-linking/mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and introduce an 
innovative approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive PAiring StatisticS). In this 
work, we show that the conformational ensemble of α-syn shifts from a 
"hairpin-like" structure towards more "elongated" conformational states upon 
LLPS. We obtain insights into the critical initial stages of LLPS and establish 
a novel mass spectrometry-based approach that will aid to solve open questions 
in LLPS structural biology.

Biomacromolecules are highly promising therapeutic modalities to treat various 
diseases. However, they suffer from poor cellular membrane permeability, 
limiting their access to intracellular targets. Strategies to overcome this 
challenge often employ nanoscale carriers that can get trapped in endosomal 
compartments. Here we report conjugated peptides that form pH- and 
redox-responsive coacervate microdroplets by liquid-liquid phase separation that 
readily cross the cell membrane. A wide range of macromolecules can be quickly 
recruited within the microdroplets, including small peptides, enzymes as large 
as 430 kDa and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The therapeutic-loaded coacervates bypass 
classical endocytic pathways to enter the cytosol, where they undergo 
glutathione-mediated release of payload, the bioactivity of which is retained in 
the cell, while mRNAs exhibit a high transfection efficiency. These peptide 
coacervates represent a promising platform for the intracellular delivery of a 
large palette of macromolecular therapeutics that have potential for treating 
various pathologies (for example, cancers and metabolic diseases) or as carriers 
for mRNA-based vaccines.

Porous polyimide (PI) films are a promising low-k dielectric material for 
high-frequency data transmission with low signal attenuation. Pores are 
generated by non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) during phase inversion 
of polymer solution via non-solvent accumulation and solvent diffusion. In this 
study, aromatic PI was employed as a matrix for NIPS, and the influence of 
polymer concentration and liquid-liquid demixing time on the morphology of pores 
in the PI films was investigated. This ensured control over the porous structure 
of the PI film and provided desirable dielectric properties in a broad frequency 
range of 100 Hz-30 MHz (1.99 at 30 MHz) and thermal stability (Td5% &gt; 576 °C, 
Tg &gt; 391 °C). This study addresses the effect of polymer concentration and 
coagulation time on the morphology and physical properties of PI sponge films 
and provides guidance on the design and optimization of architectures for 
polymeric materials requiring pore modification.

Protein fibrillation and human neurodegenerative diseases, with a profound 
underlying connection suggested between them, have been the subject of intense 
investigations in the medical, biophysical and bio-engineering sciences. For 
gaining the molecular mechanistic insights into such connection, i.e., the cause 
and effect, atomic-resolution molecular structure information especially on the 
initial oligomeric states is of paramount importance, not only that on the 
mature amyloid fibrils. α-Synuclein (αSyn) and its amyloid fibril has a direct 
relevance to the Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, but what 
triggers the fibrillation is still not entirely clear. We here describe the 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of αSyn and investigate its conformational 
evolution from its monomeric state into oligomer state within the early-stage of 
the phase-separated droplets, mainly using solution and magic-angle spinning 
(MAS) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, aided with 
optical and fluorescent microscopies and CD spectroscopy. Based on the analysis 
of the intricately broadened shapes of the MAS NMR peaks observed for 
isotopically 13C-labeled His-50 of αSyn, we show that the distribution of the 
αSyn conformation is skewed from the initial completely random state to a loose 
β-rich ensembles at/around His-50 as early as day-3 (d3) within the droplet. 
This intra-droplet loose β-rich assembly showed a very slow progression until 
d8, and eventually maturated into ThT-positive, long and unbranched amyloid 
fibrils after 8 weeks. The obtained information on the evolution of the 
distribution of the conformation ensemble is unique, and difficult to obtain 
with X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). In particular, 
the sensitivity-enhanced MAS NMR based on the low-temperature dynamic nuclear 
polarization (DNP) technique was proven to be a key tool in characterizing the 
conformational ensemble with dilute protein samples such as the liquid-phase 
droplets.

AIM: To explore whether the liquid-liquid phase separation- (LLPS-) related 
genes were potential prognostic markers that could contribute to the further 
classification of low-grade gliomas (LGGs).
METHODS: The LLPS-related genes were subjected to functional enrichment 
analysis. The univariable, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and 
multivariable stepwise Cox regression analyses were performed to develop an 
LLPS-related gene signature (GS) in the discovery data set. The biological 
characteristics of the high-risk LGG were explored using gene set enrichment 
analysis. Two independent external data sets were used to validate the 
LLPS-related GS.
RESULTS: LLPS-related genes are involved in multiple important cancer-related 
biological processes and pathways in LGG. Nine LLPS-related genes were 
identified to construct the LLPS-related GS, which was significantly associated 
with the prognosis of LGG patients. The LLPS-related GS could successfully 
divide patients with LGG into high- and low-risk groups, and the high-risk group 
showed a poorer prognosis than the low-risk group. Furthermore, the LLPS-related 
GS was independent of IDH and 1p19q status. Several cancer-related pathways may 
be more active in high-risk LGGs, such as IL6 JAK STAT3 signaling pathway. The 
LLPS-related GS was successfully validated with two independent external data 
sets.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a novel LLPS-related GS for risk 
stratification of LGG. Our findings may provide more precise management for LGGs 
and a useful reference for LLPS mechanism to link LGG studies.

Abnormal phase transitions have been implicated in the occurrence of 
proteinopathies. Disordered proteins with nucleic acidbinding ability drive the 
formation of reversible micron-sized condensates capable of controlling nucleic 
acid processing/transport. This mechanism, achieved via liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS), underlies the formation of long-studied membraneless 
organelles (e.g., nucleolus) and various transient condensates formed by driver 
proteins. The prion protein (PrP) is not a classical nucleic acid-binding 
protein. However, it binds nucleic acids with high affinity, undergoes 
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, contains a long intrinsically disordered region 
rich in glycines and evenly spaced aromatic residues, among other 
biochemical/biophysical properties of bona fide drivers of phase transitions. 
Because of this, our group and others have characterized LLPS of recombinant 
PrP. In vitro phase separation of PrP is modulated by nucleic acid aptamers, and 
depending on the aptamer conformation, the liquid droplets evolve to solid-like 
species. Herein, we discuss recent studies and previous evidence supporting PrP 
phase transitions. We focus on the central role of LLPS related to PrP 
physiology and pathology, with a special emphasis on the interaction of PrP with 
different ligands, such as proteins and nucleic acids, which can play a role in 
prion disease pathogenesis. Finally, we comment on therapeutic strategies 
directed at the non-functional phase separation that could potentially tackle 
prion diseases or other protein misfolding disorders.

The landscape of cell-surface signaling is formidably complex. Robust tools 
capable of manipulating the spatiotemporal distribution of cell-surface proteins 
(CSPs) for dissecting signaling are in high demand. Some CSPs are regulated via 
multivalency-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Employing the 
robustness and versatility of LLPS, we decided to engineer LLPS-based tools for 
precisely manipulating CSPs. We generated membrane-tethering LLPS systems by 
fusing multivalent modular phase-separation scaffold pairs with CSP binders. 
Phase separation of the scaffold pairs, concomitant compartmentalization of CSPs 
on membranes, and cluster-dependent signaling outputs of CSPs require membrane 
recruitment of one or both scaffolds. We also engineered orthogonal 
phase-separation systems to segregate CSPs into mutually exclusive compartments. 
The engineered phase-separation systems can robustly cluster individual CSPs, 
co-cluster two or more CSPs, or segregate different CSPs into distinct 
compartments on cell surfaces. These tools will enable the dissection of 
complicated cell-signaling landscapes with high precision.

Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds and stabilizes axonal 
microtubules (MTs) in neurons of the central nervous system. The binding of Tau 
to MTs is mediated by its repeat domain and flanking proline-rich domains. The 
positively charged (basic) C-terminal half of Tau also mediates the assembly Tau 
into fibrillar aggregates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tauopathy brains. In 
recent years, another assembly form of Tau has been identified: Tau can undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which leads to its condensation into 
liquid-dense phases, either by complex coacervation with polyanions like heparin 
or RNA or through "self-coacervation" at high Tau concentrations. Condensation 
of Tau in the absence of polyanions can be enhanced by the presence of molecular 
crowding agents in a dilute Tau solution. In vitro experiments using recombinant 
purified Tau are helpful to study the physicochemical determinants of Tau LLPS, 
which can then be extrapolated into the cellular context. Tau condensation is a 
new aspect of Tau biology that may play a role for the initiation of Tau 
aggregation, but also for its physiological function(s), for example, the 
binding to microtubules. Here we describe how to study the condensation of Tau 
in vitro using light microscopy, including fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching (FRAP), to assess the shape and molecular diffusion in the 
condensates, a proxy for the degree of condensate percolation. We also describe 
turbidity measurements of condensate-containing solutions to assess the overall 
amount of LLPS and time-resolved dynamic light scattering (trDLS) to study the 
formation and size of Tau condensates.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to construct and validate a robust 
prognostic model based on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)-related genes in 
lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was used as the discovery set to 
identify the LLPS-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LUSC and 
normal tissue. These DEGs were screened by the LASSO Cox regression analysis to 
identify the genes with nonzero coefficient, which were next included in the 
multivariate Cox regression analysis to construct the prediction model. The 
dataset GSE41271 was adopted as the validation set to verify the efficacy of the 
model. Enrichment analysis and the CIBERSORT were performed to illustrate 
potential immune mechanisms underlying the prediction model.
RESULTS: A total of 48 LLPS-related genes were aberrantly expressed in LUSC. 
Among them, 7 genes were selected by the LASSO Cox regression analysis to 
construct the prediction model. Risk index (RI) was calculated according to the 
model for each patient. The prognosis was significantly different between the 
patients with high and low RI in the discovery set and the validation set 
(p < 0.001 and p = 0.028, respectively). The multivariate survival analysis 
confirmed RI as an independent prognostic factor in LUSC (in the discovery set: 
p < 0.001, HR = 2.643, 95% CI = 1.986-3.518; in the validation set: p = 0.042, 
HR = 2.144, 95% CI = 1.026-4.480). A series of pathways involving immune cells 
were found to be related to RI. The distribution pattern of immune cells and 
chemokines varied according to the value of RI.
CONCLUSION: The prediction model based on LLPS-related genes was constructed and 
validated as a robust prognostic tool for LUSC using multiple datasets. LLPS 
might have an impact on LUSC through immune pathways.

In nature, simple organisms evolved mechanisms to form intricate biosilica 
nanostructures, far exceeding current synthetic manufacturing. Based on the 
properties of extracted biomacromolecules, polycation-polyanion pairs were 
suggested as moderators of biosilica formation. However, the chemical principles 
of this polymer-induced silicification remain unclear. Here, we used a 
biomimetic polycation-polyanion system to study polymer-induced silicification. 
We demonstrate that it is the polymer phase separation process, rather than 
silica-polymer interactions, which controls silica precipitation. Since ionic 
strength controls this electrostatic phase separation, it can be used to tune 
the morphology and structure of the precipitates. In situ cryo electron 
microscopy highlights the pivotal role of the hydrated polymer condensates in 
this process. These results pave the road for developing nanoscale morphologies 
of bioinspired silica based on the chemistry of liquid-liquid phase separation.

Here we describe a protocol for the generation of site-specific DNA damage, 
including double and single strand breaks, using the 405 nm laser of a confocal 
microscope in cells pre-sensitized with Hoechst. This is a simple approach, 
particularly useful to assess the involvement of proteins and the roles of 
liquid-liquid phase separation in DNA damage repair. Examples of transfection 
protocol, drug concentrations, and microscopy are provided, although 
optimization may be needed for specific experimental setups and cell lines used.

Macromolecular phase separation has recently come to immense prominence as it is 
central to the formation of membraneless organelles, leading to a new paradigm 
of cellular organization. This type of phase transition, often termed 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), is mediated by molecular interactions 
between biomolecules, including nucleic acids and both ordered and disordered 
proteins. In the latter case, the separation between protein-dense and -dilute 
phases is often interpreted using models adapted from polymer theory. 
Specifically, the "stickers and spacers" model proposes that the formation of 
condensate-spanning networks in protein solutions originates from the interplay 
between two classes of residues and that the main determinants for phase 
separation are multivalency and sequence patterning. The duality of roles of 
stickers (aromatics like Phe and Tyr) and spacers (Gly and polar residues) may 
apply more broadly in protein-like mixtures, and the presence of these two types 
of components alone may suffice for LLPS to take place. In order to explore this 
hypothesis, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of capped amino acid 
residues as a minimal model system. We study the behavior of pure amino acids in 
water for three types of residues corresponding to the spacer and sticker 
categories and of their multicomponent mixtures. In agreement with previous 
observations, we find that the spacer-type amino acids fail to phase separate on 
their own, while the sticker is prone to aggregation. However, ternary amino 
acid mixtures involving both types of amino acids phase separate into two phases 
that retain intermediate degrees of compaction and greater fluidity than 
sticker-only condensates. Our results suggest that LLPS is an emergent property 
of amino acid mixtures determined by composition.

BACKGROUND: The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biomolecules in cell 
underpins the formation of membraneless organelles, which are the condensates of 
protein, nucleic acid, or both, and play critical roles in cellular function. 
Dysregulation of LLPS is implicated in a number of diseases. Although the LLPS 
of biomolecules has been investigated intensively in recent years, the knowledge 
of the prevalence and distribution of phase separation proteins (PSPs) is still 
lag behind. Development of computational methods to predict PSPs is therefore of 
great importance for comprehensive understanding of the biological function of 
LLPS.
RESULTS: Based on the PSPs collected in LLPSDB, we developed a sequence-based 
prediction tool for LLPS proteins (PSPredictor), which is an attempt at general 
purpose of PSP prediction that does not depend on specific protein types. Our 
method combines the componential and sequential information during the protein 
embedding stage, and, adopts the machine learning algorithm for final 
predicting. The proposed method achieves a tenfold cross-validation accuracy of 
94.71%, and outperforms previously reported PSPs prediction tools. For further 
applications, we built a user-friendly PSPredictor web server ( 
http://www.pkumdl.cn/PSPredictor ), which is accessible for prediction of 
potential PSPs.
CONCLUSIONS: PSPredictor could identifie novel scaffold proteins for stress 
granules and predict PSPs candidates in the human genome for further study. For 
further applications, we built a user-friendly PSPredictor web server ( 
http://www.pkumdl.cn/PSPredictor ), which provides valuable information for 
potential PSPs recognition.

α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a natively unstructured protein, which self-assembles 
into higher-order aggregates possessing serious pathophysiological implications. 
α-Syn aberrantly self-assembles into protein aggregates, which have been widely 
implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis and other synucleinopathies. 
The self-assembly of α-Syn involves the structural conversion of soluble 
monomeric protein into oligomeric intermediates and eventually fibrillar 
aggregates of amyloids with cross-β-sheet rich conformation. These aggregated 
α-Syn species majorly constitute the intraneuronal inclusions, which is a 
hallmark of PD neuropathology. Self-assembly/aggregation of α-Syn is not a 
single-state conversion process as unfolded protein can access multiple 
conformational states through the formation of metastable, transient 
pre-fibrillar intermediate species. Recent studies have indicated that soluble 
oligomers are the potential neurotoxic species responsible for cell death in PD 
pathogenesis. The heterogeneous and transient nature of oligomers formed during 
the early stage of aggregation pathway limit their detailed study in 
understanding the structure-toxicity relationship. Moreover, the precise 
molecular events occurring in the early stage of α-Syn aggregation process 
majorly remain unsolved. Recently, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of 
α-Syn has been designated as an alternate nucleation mechanism, which occurs in 
the early lag phase of the aggregation pathway leading to the formation of 
dynamic supramolecular assemblies. The stronger self-association among the 
protein molecules triggers the irreversible liquid-to-solid transition of these 
supramolecular assemblies into the amyloid-like hydrogel, which may serve as a 
reservoir entrapping toxic oligomeric intermediates and fibrils. This review 
strives to provide insights into different modes of α-Syn self-assemblies 
including LLPS-mediated self-assembly and its recent advancements.

Aromatic residues appeared relatively late in the evolution of protein sequences 
to stabilize the globular proteins' folding core and are less in the 
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Recent advances in protein 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) studies have also shown that aromatic 
residues in IDRs often act as "stickers" to promote multivalent interactions in 
forming higher-order oligomers. To study how general these structure-promoting 
residues are in IDRs, we compared levels of sequence disorder in RNA binding 
proteins (RBPs), which are often found to undergo LLPS, and the human proteome. 
We found that aromatic residues appear more frequently than expected in the IDRs 
of RBPs and, through multiple sequence alignment analysis, those aromatic 
residues are often conserved among chordates. Using TDP-43, FUS, and some other 
well-studied LLPS proteins as examples, the conserved aromatic residues are 
important to their LLPS-related functions. These analyses suggest that aromatic 
residues may have contributed twice to evolution: stabilizing structured 
proteins and assembling biomolecular condensates.

SHP1 is a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is widely expressed in 
hematopoietic cells such as white blood cells, neutrophils, and immune cells. 
SHP1 can regulate the occurrence and differentiation of immune cells and plays 
an important role as a tumor suppressor. Previous studies have suggested that 
SHP2, the homologous protein of phosphatase SHP1, can undergo liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS). Therefore, in this study, we investigated if SHP1 is 
also capable of LLPS. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to 
reveal that SHP1 has the ability to undergo LLPS. In addition, we identified an 
important residue, SHP1-R360E, that can completely inhibit the LLPS ability of 
SHP1, but this mutation has no remarkable effect on SHP1's enzymatic activity. 
This allows us to explore the phosphatase activity and phase separation ability 
of SHP1 separately, providing a basis for future exploration of the phase 
separation mechanism of phosphatases.

Fundamental discoveries have shaped our molecular understanding of presynaptic 
processes, such as neurotransmitter release, active zone organization and 
mechanisms of synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling. However, certain regulatory steps 
still remain incompletely understood. Protein liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) and its role in SV clustering and active zone regulation now introduce a 
new perception of how the presynapse and its different compartments are 
organized. This article highlights the newly emerging concept of LLPS at the 
synapse, providing a systematic overview on LLPS tendencies of over 500 
presynaptic proteins, spotlighting individual proteins and discussing recent 
progress in the field. Newly discovered LLPS systems like ELKS/liprin-alpha and 
Eps15/FCho are put into context, and further LLPS candidate proteins, including 
epsin1, dynamin, synaptojanin, complexin and rabphilin-3A, are highlighted.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has assumed a prominent role in biological 
cell systems, where it underpins the formation of subcellular compartments 
necessary for cell function. We investigated the underlying mechanism of LLPS in 
virus infected cells, where virus inclusion bodies are formed by an RNA-binding 
phosphoprotein (NS2) of Bluetongue virus to serve as sites for subviral particle 
assembly and virus maturation. We show that NS2 undergoes LLPS that is dependent 
on protein phosphorylation and RNA-binding and that LLPS occurrence is 
accompanied by a change in protein secondary structure. Site-directed 
mutagenesis identified two critical arginine residues in NS2 responsible for 
specific RNA binding and thus for NS2-RNA complex driven LLPS. Reverse genetics 
identified the same residues as essential for VIB assembly in infected cells and 
virus viability. Our findings suggest that a specific arginine-RNA interaction 
in the context of a phosphorylated state drives LLPS in this, and possibly 
other, virus infections.

The liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of amphiphilic thermoresponsive 
copolymers can lead to the formation of micron-sized domains, known as simple 
coacervates. Due to their potential to confine active principles, these 
copolymer-rich droplets have gained interest as encapsulating agents. 
Understanding and controlling the conditions inducing this LLPS is therefore 
essential for applicative purposes and requires thorough fundamental studies on 
self-coacervation. In this work, we investigate the LLPS of a comb-like graft 
copolymer (PEG-g-PVAc) consisting of a poly(ethylene glycol) backbone (6 kDa) 
with ∼2-3 grafted poly(vinyl acetate) chains, and a PEG/PVAc weight ratio of 
40/60. Specifically, we report the effect of various water-soluble additives on 
its phase separation behavior. Kosmotropes and non-ionic surfactants were found 
to decrease the phase separation temperature of the copolymer, while chaotropes 
and, above all, ionic surfactants increased it. We then focus on the phase 
behavior of PEG-g-PVAc in the presence of sodium citrate and a C14-15 E7 
non-ionic surfactant (N45-7), defining the compositional range for the 
generation of LLPS microdomains at room temperature and monitoring their 
formation with fluorescence confocal microscopy. Finally, we determine the 
composition of the microdomains through confocal Raman microscopy, demonstrating 
the presence of PEG-g-PVAc, N45-7, and water. These results expand our knowledge 
on polymeric self-coacervation, clarifying the optimal conditions and 
composition needed to obtain LLPS microdomains with encapsulation potential at 
room temperature in surfactant-rich formulations.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a global public health concern, which is 
mainly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Cytotoxic necrotizing 
factor 1 (CNF1) is a key UPEC toxin and regulates multiple host cellular 
processes through activating the Rho GTPases; however, the effect of CNF1 on 
macrophage polarization remains unknown. Here, we found that CNF1 promoted M1 
macrophage polarization through regulating NF-κB and JAK-STAT1 signaling 
pathways in kidney at an early stage of acute UTIs. Notably, we identified CNF1 
could directly interact with JAK1/2 through its domain without Rho GTPases 
activation, which induced JAK1/2 phosphorylation, subsequent STAT1 activation 
and M1 polarization. Moreover, CNF1 exhibited liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) to induce a CNF1-JAK1/2 complex, promoting macrophage reprogramming. 
These findings highlight the LLPS-dependent and Rho GTPase-independent effect of 
CNF1 as an adaptor on interfering with host cell signals. IMPORTANCE CNF1 is a 
key toxin secreted by UPEC, which induces inflammation during UPEC infections. 
CNF1 is well known to activate Rho GTPases to disturb host cell signaling 
pathways. Macrophage reprogramming plays important roles in inflammation; 
however, the effect of CNF1 on macrophage polarization is not reported. This 
study demonstrated the role and mechanism of CNF1 in promoting M1 macrophage 
polarization during UPEC-induced acute kidney infections. Importantly, we 
identified Rho GTPase-independent effect of CNF1 as an adaptor on interfering 
with host cell signals and demonstrated that CNF1 exhibited LLPS to drive its 
interaction with host proteins, which improve our understanding of the UPEC-host 
interactions and UTI pathogenesis.

As an oncogenic transcription factor, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) regulates enhancer and 
promoter connection. However, gaps still exist in understanding how YY1 
coordinates coactivators and chromatin enhancer elements to assemble enhancers 
and super-enhancers. Here, we demonstrate that a histidine cluster in YY1's 
transactivation domain is essential for its formation of phase separation 
condensates, which can be extended to additional proteins. The histidine cluster 
is also required for YY1-promoted cell proliferation, migration, clonogenicity 
and tumor growth. YY1-rich nuclear puncta contain coactivators EP300, BRD4, MED1 
and active RNA polymerase II, and colocalize with histone markers of gene 
activation, but not that of repression. Furthermore, YY1 binds to the consensus 
motifs in the FOXM1 promoter to activate its expression. Wild-type YY1, but not 
its phase separation defective mutant, connects multiple enhancer elements and 
the FOXM1 promoter to form an enhancer cluster. Consistently, fluorescent in 
situ hybridization (FISH) assays reveal the colocalization of YY1 puncta with 
both the FOXM1 gene locus and its nascent RNA transcript. Overall, this study 
demonstrates that YY1 activates target gene expression through forming 
liquid-liquid phase separation condensates to compartmentalize both coactivators 
and enhancer elements, and the histidine cluster of YY1 plays a determinant role 
in this regulatory mechanism.

CTCF is crucial to the organization of mammalian genomes into loop structures. 
According to recent studies, the transcription apparatus is compartmentalized 
and concentrated at super-enhancers to form phase-separated condensates and 
drive the expression of cell-identity genes. However, it remains unclear whether 
and how transcriptional condensates are coupled to higher-order chromatin 
organization. Here, we show that CTCF is essential for RNA polymerase II (Pol 
II)-mediated chromatin interactions, which occur as hyperconnected spatial 
clusters at super-enhancers. We also demonstrate that CTCF clustering, unlike 
Pol II clustering, is independent of liquid-liquid phase-separation and 
resistant to perturbation of transcription. Interestingly, clusters of Pol II, 
BRD4, and MED1 were found to dissolve upon CTCF depletion, but were reinstated 
upon restoration of CTCF, suggesting a potent instructive function for CTCF in 
the formation of transcriptional condensates. Overall, we provide evidence 
suggesting that CTCF-mediated chromatin looping acts as an architectural 
prerequisite for the assembly of phase-separated transcriptional condensates.

Background: The role of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cancer has also 
attracted more and more attention, which is found to affect transcriptional 
regulation, maintaining genomic stability and signal transduction, and 
contribute to the occurrence and progression of tumors. However, the role of 
LLPS in digestive system tumors is still largely unknown. Results: Here, we 
characterized the expression profiles of LLPS regulators in 3 digestive tract 
tumor types such as COAD, STAD, and ESCA with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
data. Our results for the first time showed that LLPS regulatory factors, such 
as Brd4, FBN1, and TP53, were frequently mutated in all types of digestive 
system tumors. Variant allele frequency (VAF) and APOBEC analysis demonstrated 
that genetic alterations of LLPS regulators were related to the progression of 
digestive system neoplasms (DSNs), such as TP53, NPHS1, TNRC6B, ITSN1, TNPO1, 
PML, AR, BRD4, DLG4, and PTPN1. KM plotter analysis showed that the mutation 
status of LLPS regulators was significantly related to the overall survival (OS) 
time of DSNs, indicating that they may contribute to the progression of DSN. The 
expression analysis of LLPS regulatory factors showed that a variety of LLPS 
regulatory factors were significantly dysregulated in digestive system tumors, 
such as SYN2 and MAPT. It is worth noting that we first found that LLPS 
regulatory factors were significantly correlated with tumor immune infiltration 
of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in digestive system tumors. 
Bioinformatics analysis showed that the LLPS regulators' expression was closely 
related to multiple signaling, including the ErbB signaling pathway and T-cell 
receptor signaling pathway. Finally, several LLPS signatures were constructed 
and had a strong prognostic stratification ability in different digestive gland 
tumors. Finally, the results demonstrated the LLPS regulators' signature score 
was significantly positively related to the infiltration levels of CD4+ T cells, 
neutrophil cells, macrophage cells, and CD8+ T cells. Conclusion: Our study for 
the first time showed the potential roles of LLPS regulators in carcinogenesis 
and provide novel insights to identify novel biomarkers for the prediction of 
immune therapy and prognosis of DSNs.

The complexation between two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PE) can lead 
liquid-liquid (complex coacervates, CC) or liquid-solid (solid precipitates, SP) 
phase separations. Herein, the effect of pH (2-11) and ionic strength (I, 
0.05-1.0 M KCl) on the associative interactions between chitosan (QL)-alginate 
(SA) and QL-Pectin (Pec), polysaccharides widely used in biotechnology field, is 
described. pH and I, exhibited significant effect on the structure and phase 
transitions by modifying the ionization degree (α), pka, and associative 
interactions between PE. Onset of binding was established at pHc 9, while 
continued acidification (pHτ 5.8) led to simultaneous CC and SP exhibiting a 
maximum turbidity in both systems. At pHδ 4.0, QL-Pec showed preferably CC 
structures whereas QL-SA maintained the CC and SP structures. At pHω 2, the 
associative interactions were suppressed due to the low ionization of Pec and 
SA. I (1.0 M) significantly diminished the interactions in QL-Pec due to charge 
screening. Molecular weight, second virial coefficient, hydrodynamic size, 
ionizable groups, and persistence length of polyion, influenced on the phase 
behavior of QL-Pec and QL-SA systems. Therefore, CC and SP are found 
simultaneously in both systems, their transitions can be modulated by intrinsic 
and environmental conditions, expanding the functional properties of complexed 
polysaccharides.

Liquid-liquid phase separation underlies the formation of membrane-less 
organelles inside living cells. The mechanism of this process can be examined 
using simple aqueous mixtures of two or more solutes, which are able to phase 
separate at specific concentration thresholds. This work presents the first 
experimental evidence that mesoscopic changes precede visually detected 
macroscopic phase separation in aqueous mixtures of two polymers and a single 
polymer and salt. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis indicates the 
formation of mesoscopic polymer agglomerates in these systems. These 
agglomerates increase in size with increasing polymer concentrations prior to 
visual phase separation. Such mesoscopic changes are paralleled by changes in 
water structure as evidenced by Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform 
Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic analysis of OH-stretch bands. Through 
OH-stretch band analysis, we obtain quantitative estimates of the relative 
fractions of four subpopulations of water structures coexisting in aqueous 
solutions. These estimates indicate that abrupt changes in hydrogen bond 
arrangement take place at concentrations below the threshold of macroscopic 
phase separation. We used these experimental observations to develop a model of 
phase separation in aqueous media.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecological tumors in 
developed countries. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer 
and the changes in the immune microenvironment are still unclear. It is 
necessary to explore new biomarkers to guide the diagnosis and treatment of 
endometrial cancer.
METHODS: The GEO database was used to download the endometrial cancer single 
cell sequencing dataset GSE173682. The UCSC database was used to download 
transcriptome sequencing data. The validation set was the transcriptome dataset 
GSE119041, which was retrieved from the GEO database. On the DrLLPS website, 
liquid-liquid phase separation-related genes can be downloaded. Relevant hub 
genes were found using weighted co-expression network analysis and dimension 
reduction clustering analysis. Prognostic models were built using Lasso 
regression and univariate COX regression. Analyses of immune infiltration were 
employed to investigate the endometrial cancer immunological microenvironment. 
The expression of model genes in endometrial cancer was confirmed using a PCR 
test.
RESULTS: We created an LLPS-related predictive model for endometrial cancer by 
extensive study, and it consists of four genes: EIF2S2, SNRPC, PRELID1, and 
NDUFB9. Patients with endometrial cancer may be classified into high-risk and 
low-risk groups based on their risk scores, and those in the high-risk group had 
significantly worse prognoses (P<0.05). Additionally, there were notable 
variations in the immunological milieu between the groups at high and low risk. 
EIF2S2, SNRPC, PRELID1, and NDUFB9 were all up-regulated in endometrial cancer 
tissues, according to PCR results.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study can provide a certain reference for the diagnosis and 
treatment of endometrial cancer.

We report a new mechanism of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA regulation and 
cytoprotection in response to AR pathway inhibition (ARPI) stress in prostate 
cancer (PCA). AR mRNA translation is coordinately regulated by RNA binding 
proteins, YTHDF3 and G3BP1. Under ambient conditions m6A-modified AR mRNA is 
bound by YTHDF3 and translationally stimulated, while m6A-unmodified AR mRNA is 
bound by G3BP1 and translationally repressed. When AR-regulated PCA cell lines 
are subjected to ARPI stress, m6A-modified AR mRNA is recruited from actively 
translating polysomes (PSs) to RNA-protein stress granules (SGs), leading to 
reduced AR mRNA translation. After ARPI stress, m6A-modified AR mRNA 
liquid-liquid phase separated with YTHDF3, while m6A-unmodified AR mRNA phase 
separated with G3BP1. Accordingly, these AR mRNA messages form two distinct 
YTHDF3-enriched or G3BP1-enriched clusters in SGs. ARPI-induced SG formation is 
cell-protective, which when blocked by YTHDF3 or G3BP1 silencing increases PCA 
cell death in response to ARPI stress. Interestingly, AR mRNA silencing also 
delays ARPI stress-induced SG formation, highlighting its supportive role in 
triggering this stress response. Our results define a new mechanism for stress 
adaptive cell survival after ARPI stress involving SG-regulated translation of 
AR mRNA, mediated by m6A RNA modification and their respective regulatory 
proteins.

Loss of TDP-43 protein homeostasis and dysfunction, in particular TDP-43 
aggregation, are tied to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD). TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein tightly controlling its own 
expression levels through a negative feedback loop, involving TDP-43 recruitment 
to the 3' untranslated region of its own transcript. Aberrant TDP-43 expression 
caused by autoregulation defects are linked to TDP-43 pathology. Therefore, 
interactions between TDP-43 and its own transcript are crucial to prevent TDP-43 
aggregation and loss of function. However, the mechanisms that mediate this 
interaction remain ill-defined. We find that a central RNA sequence in the 3' 
UTR, which mediates TDP-43 autoregulation, increases the liquid properties of 
TDP-43 phase separation. Furthermore, binding to this RNA sequence induces 
TDP-43 condensation in human cell lysates, suggesting that this interaction 
promotes TDP-43 self-assembly into dynamic ribonucleoprotein granules. In 
agreement with these findings, our experiments show that TDP-43 oligomerization 
and phase separation, mediated by the amino and carboxy-terminal domains, 
respectively, are essential for TDP-43 autoregulation. According to our 
additional observations, CLIP34-associated phase separation and autoregulation 
may be efficiently controlled by phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain. 
Importantly, we find that specific ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations, mainly 
M337V, and a shortened TDP-43 isoform recently tied to motor neuron toxicity in 
ALS, disrupt the liquid properties of TDP-43-RNA condensates as well as 
autoregulatory function. In addition, we find that M337V decreases the cellular 
clearance of TDP-43 and other RNA binding proteins associated with ALS/FTD. 
These observations suggest that loss of liquid properties in M337V condensates 
strongly affects protein homeostasis. Together, this work provides evidence for 
the central role of TDP-43 oligomerization and liquid-liquid phase separation 
linked to RNA binding in autoregulation. These mechanisms may be impaired by 
TDP-43 disease variants and controlled by specific cellular signaling.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system fulfills an essential role in regulating protein 
homeostasis by spatially and temporally controlling proteolysis in an ATP- and 
ubiquitin-dependent manner. However, the localization of proteasomes is highly 
variable under diverse cellular conditions. In yeast, newly synthesized 
proteasomes are primarily localized to the nucleus during cell proliferation. 
Yeast proteasomes are transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore 
either as immature subcomplexes or as mature enzymes via adapter proteins Sts1 
and Blm10, while in mammalian cells, postmitotic uptake of proteasomes into the 
nucleus is mediated by AKIRIN2, an adapter protein essentially required for 
nuclear protein degradation. Stressful growth conditions and the reversible halt 
of proliferation, that is quiescence, are associated with a decline in ATP and 
the reorganization of proteasome localization. Cellular stress leads to 
proteasome accumulation in membraneless granules either in the nucleus or in the 
cytoplasm. In quiescence, yeast proteasomes are sequestered in an 
ubiquitin-dependent manner into motile and reversible proteasome storage 
granules in the cytoplasm. In cancer cells, upon amino acid deprivation, heat 
shock, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, or the inhibition of either proteasome 
activity or nuclear export, reversible proteasome foci containing 
polyubiquitinated substrates are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation in the 
nucleus. In this review, we summarize recent literature revealing new links 
between nuclear transport, ubiquitin signaling, and the intracellular 
organization of proteasomes during cellular stress conditions.

The protein high mobility group A1 (HMGA1) is an important regulator of 
chromatin organization and function. However, the mechanisms by which it exerts 
its biological function are not fully understood. Here, we report that the HMGA 
isoform, HMGA1a, nucleates into foci that display liquid-like properties in the 
nucleus, and that the protein readily undergoes phase separation to form liquid 
condensates in vitro. By bringing together machine-leaning modelling, cellular 
and biophysical experiments and multiscale simulations, we demonstrate that 
phase separation of HMGA1a is promoted by protein-DNA interactions, and has the 
potential to be modulated by post-transcriptional effects such as 
phosphorylation. We further show that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal 
tail of HMGA1a significantly contributes to its phase separation through 
electrostatic interactions via AT hooks 2 and 3. Our work sheds light on HMGA1 
phase separation as an emergent biophysical factor in regulating chromatin 
structure.

In recent years, processing bodies (P-bodies) formed by liquid-liquid phase 
separation, have attracted growing scientific attention due to their involvement 
in numerous cellular activities, including the regulation of mRNAs decay or 
storage. These cytoplasmic dynamic membraneless granules contain mRNA storage 
and decay components such as deadenylase and decapping factors. In addition, 
different mRNA metabolic regulators, including m6A readers and gene-mediated 
miRNA-silencing, are also associated with such P-bodies. Cancerous cells may 
profit from these mRNA decay shredders by up-regulating the expression level of 
oncogenes and down-regulating tumor suppressor genes. The main challenges of 
cancer treatment are drug resistance, metastasis, and cancer relapse likely 
associated with cancer stem cells, heterogeneity, and plasticity features of 
different tumors. The mRNA metabolic regulators based on P-bodies play a great 
role in cancer development and progression. The dysregulation of P-bodies 
mediators affects mRNA metabolism. However, less is known about the relationship 
between P-bodies mediators and cancerous behavior. The current review summarizes 
the recent studies on P-bodies mediators, their contribution to tumor 
development, and their potential in the clinical setting, particularly 
highlighting the P-bodies as potential drug-carriers such as exosomes to 
anticancer in the future.

HYPOTHESIS: The role of amylose and amylopectin in the formation of cryogels 
based on Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and starch is poorly understood. A systematic 
investigation of simplified systems containing PVA, amylose, and/or amylopectin 
constitutes the basis to predict the final features of PVA/starch cryogels by 
knowing their composition, and the amylose content of the employed raw starches.
EXPERIMENTS: Pre-gel solutions and cryogels containing PVA/amylose, 
PVA/amylopectin, and PVA/amylose/amylopectin in variable ratios were 
investigated employing small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), confocal laser 
scanning microscopy (CLSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and 
rheological measurements. The gel fraction (G%) of 23 samples with variable 
compositions was calculated and plotted to predict the G% (the gel fraction) of 
any PVA/amylose/amylopectin mixing ratio.
FINDINGS: We report on how the PVA, amylose, and amylopectin composition affect 
the properties of the final polymer blend and cryogel formation. In particular, 
PVA/amylose and PVA/amylopectin show different behaviors with respect to cryogel 
formation. We show that is possible to predict cryogel formation by using the 
simple G% parameter for any PVA/amylose/amylopectin mixing ratio, ruling out the 
starch botanical origin in the gel formation. The results reported in this work 
represent a simple tool, able to predict the formation of high-quality biobased 
materials that can replace fully synthetic materials with a significantly 
positive impact on our ecosystem.

In Tau protein condensates formed by the Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) 
process, liquid-to-solid transitions lead to the formation of fibrils implicated 
in Alzheimer's disease. Here, by tracking two contacting Tau-rich droplets using 
a simple and nonintrusive video microscopy, we found that the halftime of the 
liquid-to-solid transition in the Tau condensate is affected by the Hofmeister 
series according to the solvation energy of anions. After dissecting functional 
groups of physiologically relevant small molecules using a multivariate 
approach, we found that charged groups facilitate the liquid-to-solid transition 
in a manner similar to the Hofmeister effect, whereas hydrophobic alkyl chains 
and aromatic rings inhibit the transition. Our results not only elucidate the 
driving force of the liquid-to-solid transition in Tau condensates, but also 
provide guidelines to design small molecules to modulate this important 
transition for many biological functions for the first time.

Dishvelled-2 (Dvl2) is an essential component of Wnt pathway, which controls 
several cell fate decisions during development such as proliferation, survival 
and differentiation. Dvl2 forms higher-order protein assemblies in cell that are 
critical for relaying the signal from upstream Wnt ligand-Frizzled receptor 
binding to downstream effector β-catenin activation. However, the precise 
molecular nature and contribution of Dvl2 protein assemblies during Wnt 
signaling is unknown. Here, we show that Dvl2 forms protein condensates driven 
by liquid-liquid phase separation. An intrinsically disordered region (IDR) on 
the N-terminus is essential for Dvl2 phase separation. Importantly, we 
identified a HECT-E3 ligase WWP2 as an essential driver of Dvl2 phase separation 
in vitro and in cells. We demonstrated that ubiquitination of Dvl2 through K63 
linkage by WWP2 is required for formation of Dvl2 condensates. Phase separated 
Dvl2 activates Wnt signaling by sequestering the components of destruction 
complex and thus relieving β-catenin. Together, our results reveal a 
ubiquitination-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation as a new identity for 
Dvl2 in cells, which is necessary for transduction of Wnt signaling.

Chirality is a critical issue in pharmaceutics, forensic chemistry, therapeutic 
drug monitoring, doping control, toxicology, or environmental investigations as 
enantiomers of a chiral compound can exhibit different activities, i.e., one 
enantiomer can have the desired effect while the other one can be inactive or 
even toxic. To monitor enantioselective metabolism or 
toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic mechanisms in extremely low content in biological or 
environmental matrices, sample preparation is vital. The present review 
describes current status of development of liquid-phase microextraction 
approaches such as hollow fiber liquid-phase microextraction (HF-LPME), 
electromembrane extraction (EME), dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 
(DLLME), and supramolecular solvent-based microextraction (SSME), used for 
sample preparation of enantiomers/chiral compounds. The advantages and 
limitations of the above techniques are discussed. Attention is also focused on 
chiral separation approaches commonly applied to study the stereo-selective 
metabolism or toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic mechanisms of enantiomers in the 
biological and environmental samples.

Intermolecular interactions in protein solutions, in general, contain many 
contributions. If short-range attractions dominate, the state diagram exhibits 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that is metastable with respect to 
crystallization. In this case, the extended law of corresponding states (ELCS) 
suggests that thermodynamic properties are insensitive to details of the 
underlying interaction potential. Using lysozyme solutions, we investigate the 
applicability of the ELCS to the static structure factor and how far effective 
colloidal interaction models can help to rationalize the phase behavior and 
interactions of protein solutions in the vicinity of the LLPS binodal. The 
(effective) structure factor has been determined by small-angle x-ray 
scattering. It can be described by Baxter's adhesive hard-sphere model, which 
implies a single fit parameter from which the normalized second virial 
coefficient b2 is inferred and found to quantitatively agree with previous 
results from static light scattering. The b2 values are independent of protein 
concentration but systematically vary with temperature and solution composition, 
i.e., salt and additive content. If plotted as a function of temperature 
normalized by the critical temperature, the values of b2 follow a universal 
behavior. These findings validate the applicability of the ELCS to globular 
protein solutions and indicate that the ELCS can also be reflected in the 
structure factor.

A variety of membraneless organelles, often termed "biological condensates", 
play an important role in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene 
transcription, translation, and protein quality control. On the basis of 
experimental and theoretical investigations, liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the origin of biological 
condensates. LLPS requires multivalent macromolecules that template the 
formation of long-range, intermolecular interaction networks and results in the 
formation of condensates with defined composition and material properties. 
Multivalent interactions driving LLPS exhibit a wide range of modes from highly 
stereospecific to nonspecific and involve both folded and disordered regions. 
Multidomain proteins serve as suitable macromolecules for promoting phase 
separation and achieving disparate functions due to their potential for 
multivalent interactions and regulation. Here, we aim to highlight the influence 
of the domain architecture and interdomain interactions on the phase separation 
of multidomain protein condensates. First, the general principles underlying 
these interactions are illustrated on the basis of examples of multidomain 
proteins that are predominantly associated with nucleic acid binding and protein 
quality control and contain both folded and disordered regions. Next, the 
examples showcase how LLPS properties of folded and disordered regions can be 
leveraged to engineer multidomain constructs that form condensates with the 
desired assembly and functional properties. Finally, we highlight the need for 
improvements in coarse-grained computational models that can provide 
molecular-level insights into multidomain protein condensates in conjunction 
with experimental efforts.

The transcription factors (TFs) OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG are key players of the gene 
regulatory network of pluripotent stem cells. Evidence accumulated in recent 
years shows that even small imbalances in the expression levels or relative 
concentrations of these TFs affect both, the maintenance of pluripotency and 
cell fate decisions. In addition, many components of the transcriptional 
machinery including RNA polymerases, cofactors and TFs such as those required 
for pluripotency, do not distribute homogeneously in the nucleus but concentrate 
in multiple foci influencing the delivery of these molecules to their 
DNA-targets. How cells control strict levels of available pluripotency TFs in 
this heterogeneous space and the biological role of these foci remain elusive. 
In recent years, a wealth of evidence led to propose that many of the nuclear 
compartments are formed through a liquid-liquid phase separation process. This 
new paradigm early penetrated the stem cells field since many key players of the 
pluripotency circuitry seem to phase-separate. Overall, the formation of liquid 
compartments may modulate the kinetics of biochemical reactions and consequently 
regulate many nuclear processes. Here, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge 
of compartmentalization in the cell nucleus and the relevance of this process 
for transcriptional regulation, particularly in pluripotent stem cells. We also 
highlight the recent advances and new ideas in the field showing how 
compartmentalization may affect pluripotency preservation and cell fate 
decisions.

Stress response is important for sensing and adapting to environmental changes. 
Recently, RNA-protein (RNP) condensates, which are a type of membrane-less 
organelle formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, have been proposed to 
regulate the stress response. Because RNP condensates are formed through 
interactions between positively charged proteins and negatively charged RNAs, 
the ratio of proteins to RNAs is critical for phase-separated condensate 
formation. In particular, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can efficiently nucleate 
phase-separated RNP condensates because of their secondary structure and long 
length. Therefore, increased attention has been paid to lncRNAs because of their 
potential role as a regulator of biological condensates by phase separation 
under stress response. In this review, we summarize the current research on the 
involvement of lncRNAs in the formation of RNP condensates under stress 
response. We also demonstrate that lncRNA-driven phase separation provides a 
useful basis to understanding the response to several kinds of cellular 
stresses.

The RNA binding protein Dri1 facilitates heterochromatin assembly via the RNAi 
pathway and histone deacetylases (HDAC). Dri1 contains an intrinsically 
disordered region (IDR) and three zinc fingers at its C-terminus, which are 
important for its role in heterochromatin silencing. Both IDR and zinc fingers 
have been implicated in mediating liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). In this 
study, we investigated the phase separation properties of Dri1. We observed that 
Dri1 undergoes phase separation in vitro . Dri1 also exhibits liquid-like 
behavior in vivo . Combined with our previous findings, our data support a model 
in which the phase-separated condensates formed by Dri1 may help recruit RNAi 
components and HDAC to mediate heterochromatin assembly.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays important roles in various cellular 
processes, facilitating membrane-less organelles construction, chromatin 
condensation, signal transduction on inner membrane and many other processes. 
Current perception is that LLPS relies on weak multivalent interactions and 
crowded environments intracellularly. In this study, we demonstrate that heparan 
sulfate can serve as a platform to induce the phase separation of basic 
fibroblast growth factor on cell surface. The phase separation model provides an 
alternative mechanism how bFGF is enriched to its receptors, therefore 
triggering the signaling transduction. The research provides insights on the 
mechanism how growth factors can be recruited to cell surface by heparan sulfate 
and execute their functions, extending people's view on phase separation from 
intracellular to extracellular proteins at cellular level.

Hippo signaling in Drosophila and mammals is prominent in regulating cell 
proliferation, death and differentiation. Hippo signaling effectors (YAP and 
TAZ; also known as YAP1 and WWTR1, respectively) exhibit crosstalk with 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-Smad and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. 
Previously, we implicated Smad7 and β-catenin in mammalian myogenesis. 
Therefore, we assessed a potential role of TAZ on the Smad7-β-catenin complex in 
muscle cells. Here, we document functional interactions between Smad7, TAZ and 
β-catenin in mouse myogenic cells. Ectopic TAZ expression resulted in repression 
of the muscle-specific creatine kinase muscle (Ckm) gene promoter and its 
corresponding protein level. Depletion of endogenous TAZ enhanced Ckm promoter 
activation. Ectopic TAZ, while potently active on a TEAD reporter (HIP-HOP), 
repressed myogenin (Myog) and Myod1 enhancer regions and myogenin protein level. 
Additionally, a Wnt/β-catenin readout (TOP flash) demonstrated TAZ-mediated 
inhibition of β-catenin activity. In myoblasts, TAZ was predominantly localized 
in nuclear speckles, while in differentiation conditions TAZ was 
hyperphosphorylated at Ser89, leading to enhanced cytoplasmic sequestration. 
Finally, live-cell imaging indicated that TAZ exhibits properties of 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). These observations indicate that TAZ, as 
an effector of Hippo signaling, suppresses the myogenic differentiation 
machinery.

In mammalian male meiosis, the heterologous X and Y chromosomes remain 
unsynapsed and, as a result, are subject to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation 
(MSCI). MSCI is required for the successful completion of spermatogenesis. 
Following the initiation of MSCI, the X and Y chromosomes undergo various 
epigenetic modifications and are transformed into a nuclear body termed the XY 
body. Here, we review the mechanisms underlying the initiation of two essential, 
sequential processes in meiotic prophase I: MSCI and XY-body formation. The 
initiation of MSCI is directed by the action of DNA damage response (DDR) 
pathways; downstream of the DDR, unique epigenetic states are established, 
leading to the formation of the XY body. Accumulating evidence suggests that 
MSCI and subsequent XY-body formation may be driven by phase separation, a 
physical process that governs the formation of membraneless organelles and other 
biomolecular condensates. Thus, here we gather literature-based evidence to 
explore a phase separation hypothesis for the initiation of MSCI and the 
formation of the XY body.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) partitions cellular contents, underlies 
the formation of membraneless organelles and plays essential biological roles. 
To date, most of the research on LLPS has focused on proteins, especially 
RNA-binding proteins. However, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that RNAs 
can also function as 'scaffolds' and play essential roles in seeding or 
nucleating the formation of granules. To better utilize the knowledge dispersed 
in published literature, we here introduce RNAPhaSep (http://www.rnaphasep.cn), 
a manually curated database of RNAs undergoing LLPS. It contains 1113 entries 
with experimentally validated RNA self-assembly or RNA and protein co-involved 
phase separation events. RNAPhaSep contains various types of information, 
including RNA information, protein information, phase separation experiment 
information and integrated annotation from multiple databases. RNAPhaSep 
provides a valuable resource for exploring the relationship between RNA 
properties and phase behaviour, and may further enhance our comprehensive 
understanding of LLPS in cellular functions and human diseases.

Complex, multistep biochemical reactions that routinely take place in our cells 
require high concentrations of enzymes, substrates, and other structural 
components to proceed efficiently and typically require chemical environments 
that can inhibit other reactions in their immediate vicinity. Eukaryotic cells 
solve these problems by restricting such reactions into diffusion-restricted 
compartments within the cell called organelles that can be separated from their 
environment by a lipid membrane, or into membrane-less compartments that form 
through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). One of the most easily noticeable 
and the earliest discovered organelle is the nucleus, which harbors the genetic 
material in cells where transcription by RNA polymerases produces most of the 
messenger RNAs and a plethora of noncoding RNAs, which in turn are required for 
translation of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. The interior of the nucleus is not a 
uniform soup of biomolecules and rather consists of a variety of membrane-less 
bodies, such as the nucleolus, nuclear speckles (NS), paraspeckles, Cajal 
bodies, histone locus bodies, and more. In this review, we will focus on NS with 
an emphasis on recent developments including our own findings about the 
formation of NS by two large IDR-rich proteins SON and SRRM2.

Integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) are integrin-based plasma-membrane-associated 
compartments where cells sense environmental cues. The physical mechanisms and 
molecular interactions that mediate initial IAC formation are unclear. We found 
that both p130Cas ('Cas') and Focal adhesion kinase ('FAK') undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro under physiologic conditions. Cas- and 
FAK- driven phase separation is sufficient to reconstitute kindlin-dependent 
integrin clustering in vitro with recombinant mammalian proteins. In vitro 
condensates and IACs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit similar 
sensitivities to environmental perturbations including changes in temperature 
and pH. Furthermore, mutations that inhibit or enhance phase separation in vitro 
reduce or increase the number of IACs in MEFs, respectively. Finally, we find 
that the Cas and FAK pathways act synergistically to promote phase separation, 
integrin clustering, IAC formation and partitioning of key components in vitro 
and in cells. We propose that Cas- and FAK-driven phase separation provides an 
intracellular trigger for integrin clustering and nascent IAC formation.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) move through an ensemble of 
conformations which allows multitudinous roles within a cell. Keratinocytes, the 
predominant cell type in mammalian epidermis, have had only a few individual 
proteins assessed for intrinsic disorder and its possible contribution to 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), especially in regard to what functions or 
structures these proteins provide. We took a holistic approach to keratinocyte 
IDPs starting with enrichment via the isolation of thermostable proteins. The 
keratinocyte protein involucrin, known for its resistance to heat denaturation, 
served as a marker. It and other thermostable proteins were identified by liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and subjected to extensive bioinformatic 
analysis covering gene ontology, intrinsic disorder, and potential for LLPS. 
Numerous proteins unique to keratinocytes and other proteins with shared 
expression in multiple cell types were identified to have IDP traits (e.g., 
compositional bias, nucleic acid binding, and repeat motifs). Among 
keratinocyte-specific proteins, many that co-assemble with involucrin into the 
cell-specific structure known as the cornified envelope scored highly for 
intrinsic disorder and potential for LLPS. This suggests intrinsic disorder and 
LLPS are previously unrecognized traits for assembly of the cornified envelope, 
echoing the contribution of intrinsic disorder and LLPS to more widely 
encountered features such as stress granules and PML bodies.

The aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) is a key pathological hallmark of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). α-Syn undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
to drive amyloid aggregation. How the LLPS of α-Syn is regulated remains largely 
unknown. Here, we discovered that the C-terminal region modulates α-Syn phase 
separation through electrostatic interactions. The wild-type (WT) and PD 
disease-related truncated α-Syn can co-exist in the condensates. The truncated 
α-Syn could dramatically promote WT α-Syn phase separation. Further studies 
demonstrated that the truncated α-Syn accelerated WT α-Syn turning to amyloid 
aggregates by modulation of phase separation. Together, our findings disclose 
the role of the C-terminal domain in the LLPS of α-Syn and pave the path for 
understanding the mechanism of truncated α-Syn in PD pathology.

Aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by γ-secretase is closely 
associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP) 
specifically promotes γ-secretase–mediated cleavage of APP. However, the 
underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the 16-kDa 
C-terminal fragment of GSAP (GSAP-16K) undergoes phase separation in vitro and 
forms puncta-like condensates in cells. GSAP-16K exerts dual modulation on 
γ-secretase cleavage; GSAP-16K in dilute phase increases APP–C-terminal 
99-residue fragment (C99) cleavage toward preferred production of β-amyloid 
peptide 42 (Aβ42), but GSAP-16K condensates reduce APP-C99 cleavage through 
substrate sequestration. Notably, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is markedly elevated with 
increasing concentrations of GSAP-16K. GSAP-16K stably associates with APP-C99 
through specific sequence elements. These findings mechanistically explain 
GSAP-mediated modulation of γ-secretase activity that may have ramifications on 
the development of potential therapeutics.

Amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS) is an important phase transition 
process for amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) performance both in terms of drug 
release as well as physical and chemical stability during storage. Addition of 
surfactants to ASD systems can impact both of these processes. One possible 
mechanism through which surfactants affect ASD performance is via their impact 
on AAPS. Unfortunately, despite their increasing usage in ASD formulations, the 
effect of surfactant on AAPS is still poorly understood, and there are limited 
analytical techniques that provide microstructural and composition information 
about phase separated ASDs. In this study, the impact of four surfactants 
(sodium dodecyl sulfate, Tween 80, Span 20 and Span 85) on water-induced phase 
separation in ASDs formulated with ritonavir and polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl 
acetate (PVPVA) was investigated using a variety of orthogonal analytical 
methods. Transparent films of ASDs with different compositions were prepared by 
spin coating. Fluorescence confocal microscopy in combination with an in situ 
humidity chamber was used to monitor the kinetics and morphology of phase 
separation following exposure to high relative humidity. Optical photothermal IR 
analysis of phase separated films enabled characterization of domain composition 
and surfactant distribution. Liquid-liquid phase separation concentration, zeta 
potential and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements 
enabled interpretation of interaction with and partition of surfactants into the 
drug-rich phase. It was found that phase separation kinetics and morphology were 
notably changed by the surfactants. Further, the surfactants showed different 
affinities for the drug-rich versus the aqueous/polymer-rich phases. The 
employed analytical techniques were found to be complementary in providing 
insight into surfactant location in phase separated systems. This study 
highlights the complexity of phase separation, especially in the presence of 
surfactants, and provides a foundation to understand the impact of AAPS on ASD 
performance.

Liquid-liquid phase separation provides a versatile approach to fabricating 
cell-mimicking coacervates. Recently, it was discovered that phase separation of 
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) allows for forming protocells and microgels in 
multicomponent systems. However, the mechanism of the ssDNA phase separation is 
not comprehensively understood. Here, we present mechanistic insights into the 
metal-dependent phase separation of ssDNA and leverage this understanding for a 
straightforward formation of all-DNA droplets. Two phase separation temperatures 
are found that correspond to the formation of primary nuclei and a growth 
process. Ca2+ allows for irreversible, whereas Mg2+ leads to reversible phase 
separation. Capitalizing on these differences makes it possible to control the 
information transfer of one-component DNA droplets and two-component core-shell 
protocells. This study introduces new kinetic traps of phase separating ssDNA 
that lead to new phenomena in cell-mimicking systems.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays important roles in forming cellular 
membraneless organelles. However, how host factors regulate LLPS of viral 
proteins during negative-sense RNA (NSR) virus infection is largely unknown. 
Here, we used barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV) as a model to 
demonstrate regulation of host casein kinase 1 (CK1) in phase separation and 
infection of NSR viruses. We first found that the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P) 
formed spherical granules with liquid properties and recruited viral nucleotide 
(N) and polymerase (L) proteins in vivo. Moreover, the P-formed granules were 
tethered to the ER/actin network for trafficking and fusion. BYSMV P alone 
formed droplets and incorporated the N protein and the 5' trailer of genomic RNA 
in vitro. Interestingly, phase separation of BYSMV P was inhibited by host 
CK1-dependent phosphorylation of an intrinsically disordered P protein region. 
Genetic assays demonstrated that the unphosphorylated mutant of BYSMV P 
exhibited condensed phase, which promoted viroplasm formation and virus 
replication. Whereas, the phosphorylation-mimic mutant existed in diffuse phase 
state for virus transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate that host 
CK1 modulates phase separation of the viral P protein and virus infection.

In live cells, proteins and nucleic acids can associate together through 
multivalent interactions, and form relatively isolated phases that undertake 
designated biological functions and activities. In the past decade, 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has gradually been recognized as a general 
mechanism for the intracellular organization of biomolecules. LLPS regulates the 
assembly and composition of dozens of membraneless organelles and condensates in 
cells. Due to the altered physiological conditions or genetic mutations, 
phase-separated condensates may undergo aberrant formation, maturation or 
gelation that contributes to the onset and progression of various diseases, 
including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. In this review, we summarize 
the properties of different membraneless organelles and condensates, and discuss 
multiple phase separation-regulated biological processes. Based on the 
dysregulation and mutations of several key regulatory proteins and signaling 
pathways, we also exemplify how aberrantly regulated LLPS may contribute to 
human diseases.

Liquid-liquid phase separation forms condensates that feature a highly 
concentrated liquid phase, a defined yet dynamic boundary, and dynamic exchange 
at and across the boundary. Phase transition drives the formation of dynamic 
multienzyme complexes in cells, and understanding how phase separation regulates 
multienzyme catalysis may need the help of in vitro investigations. Recently we 
have constructed synthetic versions of multienzyme biosynthetic systems by 
assembling enzymes in protein condensates. Here, we describe the methods for 
checking the enzyme assembly using fluorescent microscopy and centrifugation 
assay. We further provide steps for analysis of the cascade enzyme catalytic 
efficiencies inside the condensates, using enzymes from terpene biosynthesis 
pathway.

Phase separation is a key phenomenon in artificial cell construction. Recent 
studies have shown that the liquid-liquid phase separation of designed-DNA 
nanostructures induces the formation of liquid-like condensates that eventually 
become hydrogels by lowering the solution temperature. As a compartmental 
capsule is an essential artificial cell structure, many studies have focused on 
the lateral phase separation of artificial lipid vesicles. However, controlling 
phase separation using a molecular design approach remains challenging. Here, we 
present the lateral liquid-liquid phase separation of DNA nanostructures that 
leads to the formation of phase-separated capsule-like hydrogels. We designed 
three types of DNA nanostructures (two orthogonal and a linker nanostructure) 
that were adsorbed onto an interface of water-in-oil (W/O) droplets via 
electrostatic interactions. The phase separation of DNA nanostructures led to 
the formation of hydrogels with bicontinuous, patch, and mix patterns, due to 
the immiscibility of liquid-like DNA during the self-assembly process. The 
frequency of appearance of these patterns was altered by designing DNA sequences 
and altering the mixing ratio of the nanostructures. We constructed a phase 
diagram for the capsule-like DNA hydrogels by investigating pattern formation 
under various conditions. The phase-separated DNA hydrogels did not only form on 
the W/O droplet interface but also on the inner leaflet of lipid vesicles. 
Notably, the capsule-like hydrogels were extracted into an aqueous solution, 
maintaining the patterns formed by the lateral phase separation. In addition, 
the extracted hydrogels were successfully combined with enzymatic reactions, 
which induced their degradation. Our results provide a method for the design and 
control of phase-separated hydrogel capsules using sequence-designed DNAs. We 
envision that by incorporating various DNA nanodevices into DNA hydrogel 
capsules, the capsules will gain molecular sensing, chemical-information 
processing, and mechanochemical actuating functions, allowing the construction 
of functional molecular systems.

When p62/Sequestosome-1 binds to a ubiquitinated protein, it undergoes 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and forms a membraneless organelle, p62 
body. There are two major physiological functions of the p62 body. One is 
effective autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and the other is 
antioxidant stress response, both of which contribute to cellular homeostasis. 
In this review, I review the history of p62 research in relation to autophagy 
and outline the formation, degradation, and physiological functions of the p62

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives the formation of extensive 
membrane-less compartments to regulate various cellular biological activities 
both physiologically and pathologically. It has been widely accepted that LLPS 
is closely related to amyloid diseases and increasing reports have linked this 
phenomenon to cancers. Mutations of tumor suppressor protein p53 exist in more 
than half of malignant tumors, making the protein vitally important in cancer 
research. Recently, p53 was reported to undergo phase separation, which may 
regulate the function of p53. The molecular mechanism of p53 phase separation 
and how this process relates to cancer remains largely unclear. Herein, we find 
that the disordered unstructured basic region (UBR) plays a crucial role in p53 
LLPS, driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Mutations in the 
tetramerization domain (TD) disrupt p53 phase separation by preventing the 
tetramer formation. Furthermore, our results have revealed that, in response to 
DNA damage in cell, the wild type (WT) p53 undergoes LLPS, while LLPS in 
oncogenic mutations is diminished or eliminated. The expression of the target 
gene of p53 decreased significantly with the mutations and cell survival 
increased with the mutations. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism of p53 
carcinogenesis, whereby oncogenic mutations in TD impair the formation of p53 
condensates, decreasing the activation of target genes and promoting cancer 
progression. This study helps to understand the behavior and function of p53 in 
a different aspect and may provide insights into cancer therapies targeting p53.

conducted by LC-MS/MS. At present, most methods require liquid-liquid extraction 
or solid phase extraction for sample preparation. However, these pretreatments 
are prone to compromise LC-MS/MS throughput. To improve on the current standard 
practices, we investigated cold-induced phase separation for sex hormone 
extraction. After protein precipitation with acetonitrile and adjusting the 
solution constitution with water, samples were stored at -30°C for 10 min to 
generate two distinct phases: an acetonitrile-rich layer on top of a water-rich 
layer. During this process, the hydrophobic sex hormones spontaneously separate 
into the upper layer. This simple and reliable cold-induced phase 
separation-based LC-MS/MS methodology was used here to simultaneously detect 
estrone, estradiol, estriol, testosterone, androstenedione, 
dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in serum. 
Validation of this method indicated satisfactory performance, including 
acceptable linearity, accuracy, precision, and tractability. Compared with the 
mainstream liquid-liquid extraction-based method, this new method exhibits 
significant progress in throughput, which shortens the time cost of sample 
preparation from 90 to 40 min. We propose that this method can be an excellent 
alternative for sex hormone analysis in routine clinical laboratories.

Phase separation and biorhythms control biological processes in the spatial and 
temporal dimensions, respectively, but mechanisms of four-dimensional 
integration remain elusive. Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved 
XBP1s-SON axis that establishes a cell-autonomous mammalian 12-hour ultradian 
rhythm of nuclear speckle liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) dynamics, 
separate from both the 24-hour circadian clock and the cell cycle. Higher 
expression of nuclear speckle scaffolding protein SON, observed at early 
morning/early afternoon, generates diffuse and fluid nuclear speckles, increases 
their interactions with chromatin proactively, transcriptionally amplifies the 
unfolded protein response, and protects against proteome stress, whereas the 
opposites are observed following reduced SON level at early evening/late 
morning. Correlative Son and proteostasis gene expression dynamics are further 
observed across the entire mouse life span. Our results suggest that by 
modulating the temporal dynamics of proteostasis, the nuclear speckle LLPS may 
represent a previously unidentified (chrono)-therapeutic target for pathologies 
associated with dysregulated proteostasis.

While the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) process in proteins has been 
studied in great detail, it has not been widely explored how the associated 
protein hydration changes during the process and how crucial its role is in the 
process itself. In this contribution, we experimentally explore the alteration 
of lysozyme hydration during its LLPS process using attenuated total reflection 
(ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy in the THz frequency region (1.5-21 THz). Additionally, 
we explore the role of excipients (l-arginine, sucrose, bovine albumin (BSA), 
and ubiquitin (Ubi)) in regulating the process and found that, while sucrose 
stabilizes the LLPS, BSA inhibits it. The effect of Arg in the LLPS is subtle, 
and that of Ubi is concentration dependent. We made a detailed analysis of the 
hydration profile of Lys in the presence of these excipients and observe that a 
change in hydration in terms of H-bond making/breaking is a definite signature 
regulating the process.

Halogenated organic solvents are the most commonly detected pollutants in 
groundwater and are particularly toxic and harmful. How to separate these dense 
nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) pollutants efficiently from groundwater has 
become an important research question. Here, a novel hydrocyclone with annular 
overflow structure was designed, which eliminated the short-circuit flow of the 
traditional hydrocyclone and solved the problem of overflow entrainment caused 
by the enrichment of droplets near the locus of zero vertical velocities (LZVV) 
into turbulence. The flow field characteristics of this novel hydrocyclone were 
studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation and compared with 
the traditional hydrocyclone. It was found that the annular gap structure of the 
novel hydrocyclone increased the tangential velocity of the outer vortex. 
Moreover, the radius of the LZVV was expanded outward by 0.17 mm, which reduced 
the possibility of droplets with small particle sizes in the second phase 
escaping from the overflow pipe. The collective effect was to eliminate the 
short-circuit flow. This novel hydrocyclone was able to separate DNAPL 
pollutants with low consumption and high efficiency, across a range of inlet 
velocity from 4 to 6 m/s. The maximum separation efficiency was 99.91 %. In 
addition, with trichloroethylene (TCE) as the target pollutant, the maximum 
volume fraction of the dispersed phase in the hydrocyclone was located on the 
side wall of the hydrocyclone. Taken together, we believe that this work will 
provide a low-cost, efficient separation method for the separation of 
groundwater- contaminated liquid mixtures. Furthermore, it has broad application 
prospects in the field of heterotopic remediation of groundwater.

The mediator complex is highly conserved in eukgaryotes and is integral for 
transcriptional responses. Mediator subunits associate with signal-responsive 
transcription factors (TF) to activate expression of specific signal-responsive 
genes. As the key TF of Arabidopsis thaliana senescence, ORESARA1 (ORE1) is 
required for nitrogen deficiency (-N) induced senescence; however, the mediator 
subunit that associates with ORE1 remains unknown. Here, we show that 
Arabidopsis MED19a associates with ORE1 to activate -N senescence-responsive 
genes. Disordered MED19a forms inducible nuclear condensates under -N that is 
regulated by decreasing MED19a lysine acetylation. MED19a carboxyl terminus 
(cMED19a) harbors a mixed-charged intrinsically disordered region (MC-IDR) 
required for ORE1 interaction and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Plant 
and human cMED19 are sufficient to form heterotypic condensates with ORE1. Human 
cMED19 MC-IDR, but not yeast cMED19 IDR, partially complements med19a suggesting 
functional conservation in evolutionarily distant eukaryotes. Phylogenetic 
analysis of eukaryotic cMED19 revealed that the MC-IDR could arise through 
convergent evolution. Our result of MED19 MC-IDR suggests that plant MED19 is 
regulated by phase separation during stress responses.

The abLIM1 is a nonerythroid actin-binding protein critical for stable plasma 
membrane-cortex interactions under mechanical tension. Its depletion by RNA 
interference results in sparse, poorly interconnected cortical actin networks 
and severe blebbing of migrating cells. Its isoforms, abLIM-L, abLIM-M, and 
abLIM-S, contain, respectively four, three, and no LIM domains, followed by a C 
terminus entirely homologous to erythroid cortex protein dematin. How abLIM1 
functions, however, remains unclear. Here we show that abLIM1 is a liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS)-dependent self-organizer of actin networks. 
Phase-separated condensates of abLIM-S-mimicking ΔLIM or the major isoform 
abLIM-M nucleated, flew along, and cross-linked together actin filaments 
(F-actin) to produce unique aster-like radial arrays and interconnected webs of 
F-actin bundles. Interestingly, ΔLIM condensates facilitated actin nucleation 
and network formation even in the absence of Mg2+. Our results suggest that 
abLIM1 functions as an LLPS-dependent actin nucleator and cross-linker and 
provide insights into how LLPS-induced condensates could self-construct 
intracellular architectures of high connectivity and plasticity.

Most of the human genome, except for a small region that transcribes 
protein-coding RNAs, was considered junk. With the advent of RNA sequencing 
technology, we know that much of the genome codes for RNAs with no 
protein-coding potential. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that form a significant 
proportion are dynamically expressed and play diverse roles in physiological and 
pathological processes. Precise spatiotemporal control of their expression is 
essential to carry out various biochemical reactions inside the cell. 
Intracellular organelles with membrane-bound compartments are known for creating 
an independent internal environment for carrying out specific functions. The 
formation of membrane-free ribonucleoprotein condensates resulting in 
intracellular compartments is documented in recent times to execute specialized 
tasks such as DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodeling, transcription, 
and mRNA splicing. These liquid compartments, called membrane-less organelles 
(MLOs), are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), selectively 
partitioning a specific set of macromolecules from others. While RNA binding 
proteins (RBPs) with low complexity regions (LCRs) appear to play an essential 
role in this process, the role of RNAs is not well-understood. It appears that 
short nonspecific RNAs keep the RBPs in a soluble state, while longer RNAs with 
unique secondary structures promote LLPS formation by specifically binding to 
RBPs. This review will update the current understanding of phase separation, 
physio-chemical nature and composition of condensates, regulation of phase 
separation, the role of lncRNA in the phase separation process, and the 
relevance to cancer development and progression.

Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) has recently been widely used 
in the separation and preconcentration of various chemical species. Among the 
various approaches using DLLME are systems that use a syringe as an extraction 
environment. In this review, details of some methods that use this approach are 
presented. The ways to promote dispersion, analytical characteristics, and the 
advantages and disadvantages of the methods, among other aspects, are discussed 
critically. Finally, some trends in the use of in-syringe microextraction 
systems are described.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as an important phenomenon 
associated with formation of membraneless organelles. Recently, LLPS has been 
shown to act as nucleation centers for disease-associated protein aggregation 
and amyloid fibril formation. Phase-separated α-synuclein droplets gradually 
rigidify during the course of protein aggregation, and it is very challenging to 
understand the biomolecular interactions that lead to liquid-like to solid-like 
transition using conventional ensemble measurements. Here, we describe a 
spectrally-resolved fluorescence microscopy based Förster resonance energy 
transfer (FRET) imaging to probe interactions of α-synuclein in individual 
droplets during LLPS-mediated aggregation. By acquiring entire emission spectral 
profiles of individual droplets upon sequential excitation of acceptors and 
donors therein, this technique allows for the quantification of sensitized 
emission proportional to the extent of FRET, which enables interrogation of the 
evolution of local interactions of donor-/acceptor-labeled α-synuclein molecules 
within each droplet. The present study on single droplets is not only an 
important development for studying LLPS but can also be used to investigate 
self-assembly or aggregation in biomolecular systems and soft materials.

A self-consistent analytical solution for binodal concentrations of the 
two-component Flory-Huggins phase separation model is derived. We show that this 
form extends the validity of the Ginzburg-Landau expansion away from the 
critical point to cover the whole phase space. Furthermore, this analytical 
solution reveals an exponential scaling law of the dilute phase binodal 
concentration as a function of the interaction strength and chain length. We 
demonstrate explicitly the power of this approach by fitting experimental 
protein liquid-liquid phase separation boundaries to determine the effective 
chain length and solute-solvent interaction energies. Moreover, we demonstrate 
that this strategy allows us to resolve differences in interaction energy 
contributions of individual amino acids. This analytical framework can serve as 
a new way to decode the protein sequence grammar for liquid-liquid phase 
separation.

Liquid-liquid phase separation is a fundamental biophysical process to organize 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic cytosols. While many biomolecular condensates are 
formed in the vicinity of, or even on lipid membranes, little is known about the 
interaction of protein condensates and lipid bilayers. In this study, we 
characterize the recently unknown phase behavior of the bacterial nucleoid 
occlusion protein Noc. We find that, similarly to other ParB-like proteins, CTP 
binding tightly regulates Noc's propensity to phase separate. As CTP-binding and 
hydrolysis also allows Noc to bind and spread on membranes, we furthermore 
establish Noc condensates as model system to investigate how lipid membranes can 
influence protein condensation and vice versa. Last, we show that Noc 
condensates can recruit FtsZ to the membrane, while this does not happen in the 
non-phase separated state. These findings suggest a new model of Noc mediated 
nucleoid occlusion, with membrane-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation as 
underlying principle of complex formation and regulation thereof.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and phase transitions (PT) of proteins, 
which include the formation of gel- and solid-like species, have been 
characterized as physical processes related to the pathology of conformational 
diseases. Nucleic acid (NA)-binding proteins related to neurodegenerative 
disorders and cancer were shown by us and others to experience PT modulated by 
different NAs. Herein, we discuss recent work on phase separation and phase 
transitions of two amyloidogenic proteins, i.e. the prion protein (PrP) and p53, 
which undergo conformational changes and aggregate upon NA interaction. The role 
of different NAs in these processes is discussed to shed light on the relevance 
of PSs and PTs for both the functional and pathological roles of these mammalian 
proteins.

The protein α-synuclein, which is well-known for its links to Parkinson's 
Disease, is associated with synaptic vesicles (SVs) in nerve terminals. Despite 
intensive studies, its precise physiological function remains elusive. 
Accumulating evidence indicates that liquid-liquid phase separation takes part 
in the assembly and/or maintenance of different synaptic compartments. The 
current review discusses recent data suggesting α-synuclein as a component of 
the SV liquid phase. We also consider possible implications of these data for 
disease.

Recent progress has provided clear evidence that many RNA-viruses form 
cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation 
to facilitate their replication. In contrast, seemingly contradictory data exist 
for herpesviruses, which replicate their DNA genomes in nuclear membrane-less 
replication compartments (RCs). Here, we review the current literature and 
comment on nuclear condensate formation by herpesviruses, specifically with 
regard to RC formation. Based on data obtained with human cytomegalovirus (human 
herpesvirus 5), we propose that liquid and homogenous early RCs convert into 
more heterogeneous RCs with complex properties over the course of infection. We 
highlight how the advent of DNA replication leads to the maturation of these 
biomolecular condensates, likely by adding an additional DNA scaffold.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of multivalent biopolymers is a ubiquitous 
process in biological systems and is of importance in bio-mimetic soft matter 
design. The phase behavior of biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, 
is typically encoded by the primary chain sequence and regulated by solvent 
properties. One of the most important physical modulators of LLPS is 
temperature. Solutions of proteins and/or nucleic acids have been shown to 
undergo liquid-liquid phase separation either upon cooling (with an upper 
critical solution temperature, UCST) or upon heating (with a lower critical 
solution temperature, LCST). However, many theoretical frameworks suggest the 
possibility of more complex temperature-dependent phase behaviors, such as an 
hourglass or a closed-loop phase diagram with concurrent UCST and LCST 
transitions. Here, we report that RNA-polyamine mixtures undergo a reentrant 
phase separation with temperature. Specifically, at low temperatures, 
RNA-polyamine mixtures form a homogenous phase. Increasing the temperature leads 
to the formation of RNA-polyamine condensates. A further increase in temperature 
leads to the dissolution of condensates, rendering a reentrant homogenous phase. 
This dual-response phase separation of RNA is not unique to polyamines but also 
observed with short cationic peptides. The immiscibility gap is controlled by 
the charge of the polycation, salt concentration, and mixture composition. Based 
on the existing theories of complex coacervation, our results point to a complex 
interplay between desolvation entropy, ion-pairing, and electrostatic 
interactions in dictating the closed-loop phase behavior of RNA-polycation 
mixtures.

A large fraction of secondary aerosol particles are liquid-liquid 
phase-separated with an organic shell and an inorganic core. This has the 
potential to regulate the hygroscopicity of such particles, with significant 
implications for their optical properties, reactivity, and lifetime. However, it 
is unclear how this phase separation affects the hygroscopic growth of the 
particles. Here, we showed a large variation in hygroscopic growth (e.g., 
1.14-1.32 under a relative humidity (RH) of 90%) of particles from the forest 
and urban atmosphere, which had different average core-shell ratios. For this 
reason, a controlled laboratory experiment further quantifies the impact of the 
organic shell on particle growth with different RH values. Laboratory 
experiments demonstrated that (NH4)2SO4 particles with thicker secondary organic 
shells have a lower growth factor at an RH below 94%. Organic shells started to 
deliquesce first (RH > 50%) and the phase changes of sulfate cores from solid to 
liquid took place at an RH higher than 80% as deliquescence relative humidity of 
pure (NH4)2SO4. Our study provides the first direct evidence on an individual 
particle basis that hygroscopic growth behavior of phase-separated particles is 
dependent on the thickness of organic shells, highlighting the importance of 
organic coating in water uptake and possible heterogeneous reactions of the 
phase-separated particles.

The aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) is a critical pathological hallmark of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Prevention of α-Syn aggregation has become a key 
strategy for treating PD. Recent studies have suggested that α-Syn undergoes 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate nucleation and amyloid 
formation. Here, we examined the modulation of α-Syn aggregation by myricetin, a 
polyhydroxyflavonol compound, under the conditions of LLPS. Unexpectedly, 
neither the initial morphology nor the phase-separated fraction of α-Syn was 
altered by myricetin. However, the dynamics of α-Syn condensates decreased upon 
myricetin binding. Further studies showed that myricetin dose-dependently 
inhibits amyloid aggregation in the condensates by delaying the liquid-to-solid 
phase transition. In addition, myricetin could disassemble the preformed α-Syn 
amyloid aggregates matured from the condensates. Together, our study shows that 
myricetin inhibits α-Syn amyloid aggregation in the condensates by retarding the 
liquid-to-solid phase transition and reveals that α-Syn phase transition can be 
targeted to inhibit amyloid aggregation.

How do proteins interact in the cellular environment? Which interactions 
stabilize liquid-liquid phase separated condensates? Are the concepts, which 
have been developed for specific protein complexes also applicable to 
higher-order assemblies? Recent discoveries prompt for a universal framework for 
protein interactions, which can be applied across the scales of protein 
communities. Here, we discuss how our views on protein interactions have evolved 
from rigid structures to conformational ensembles of proteins and discuss the 
open problems, in particular related to biomolecular condensates. Protein 
interactions have evolved to follow changes in the cellular environment, which 
manifests in multiple modes of interactions between the same partners. Such 
cellular context-dependence requires multiplicity of binding modes (MBM) by 
sampling multiple minima of the interaction energy landscape. We demonstrate 
that the energy landscape framework of protein folding can be applied to explain 
this phenomenon, opening a perspective toward a physics-based, universal model 
for cellular protein behaviors.

Liquid-liquid extraction is an essential chemical separation technique where 
polar solutes are extracted from an aqueous phase into a nonpolar organic 
solvent by amphiphilic extractant molecules. A fundamental limitation to the 
efficiency of this important technology is third phase formation, wherein the 
organic phase splits upon sufficient loading of polar solutes. The nanoscale 
drivers of phase splitting are challenging to understand in the complex 
hierarchically structured organic phases. In this study, we demonstrate that the 
organic phase structure and phase behavior are fundamentally connected in a way 
than can be understood with critical phenomena theory. For a series of binary 
mixtures of trialkyl phosphate extractants with linear alkane diluents, we 
combine small angle x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations to 
demonstrate how the organic phase mesostructure over a wide range of 
compositions is dominated by critical concentration fluctuations associated with 
the critical point of the third phase formation phase transition. These findings 
reconcile many longstanding inconsistencies in the literature where small angle 
scattering features, also consistent with such critical fluctuations, were 
interpreted as reverse micellar-like particles. Overall, this study shows how 
the organic phase mesostructure and phase behavior are intrinsically linked, 
deepening our understanding of both and providing a new framework for using 
molecular structure and thermodynamic variables to control mesostructure and 
phase behavior in liquid-liquid extraction.

Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation process evolutionarily conserved from 
yeast to mammals, is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and 
combating diverse cellular stresses. Autophagy involves de novo synthesis of a 
double-membrane autophagosome, sequestration of selected cellular contents, and 
subsequent delivery of sequestrated contents to the vacuole (in yeasts and 
plants) or to lysosomes (in animal cells) for degradation and recycling. Genetic 
studies in unicellular and multicellular model organisms have systematically 
revealed the molecular machinery, regulation, and function of autophagy in 
physiological settings. I review genetic studies in model organisms-from yeast 
to worm to fly-that enable us to not only identify autophagy genes, including 
ATG genes and the metazoan-specific EPG genes, but also uncover variants of 
autophagy in developmental contexts, novel regulatory mechanisms, and signaling 
events involved in mediating systemic autophagy response. Genetic analysis also 
helps us understand the liquid-liquid phase separation and transition that 
control autophagic degradation of protein aggregates. The emerging role of 
autophagy in zebrafish tissue regeneration is also discussed.

Disordered RNA-binding proteins and repetitive RNA sequences are the main 
genetic causes of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease. Importantly, these components also 
seed the formation of cytoplasmic liquid-like granules, like stress granules and 
P bodies. Emerging evidence demonstrates that healthy granules formed via 
liquid-liquid phase separation can mature into solid- or gel-like inclusions 
that persist within the cell. These solidified inclusions are a precursor to the 
aggregates identified in patients, demonstrating that dysregulation of RNA 
granule biology is an important component of neurodegeneration. Here, we review 
recent literature highlighting how RNA molecules seed proteinaceous granules, 
the mechanisms of healthy turnover of RNA granules in cells, which biophysical 
properties underly a transition to solid- or gel-like material states, and why 
persistent granules disrupt the cellular homeostasis of neurons. We also 
identify various methods that will illuminate the contributions of disordered 
proteins and RNAs to neurodegeneration in ongoing research efforts.

Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), the go-to process for a variety of chemical 
separations, is limited by spontaneous organic phase splitting upon sufficient 
solute loading, called third phase formation. In this study we explore the 
applicability of critical phenomena theory to gain insight into this deleterious 
phase behavior with the goal of improving separations efficiency and minimizing 
waste. A series of samples representative of rare earth purification were 
constructed to include each of one light and one heavy lanthanide (cerium and 
lutetium) paired with one of two common malonamide extractants (DMDOHEMA and 
DMDBTDMA). The resulting postextraction organic phases are chemically complex 
and often form rich hierarchical structures whose statics and dynamics near the 
critical point were probed herein with small-angle X-ray scattering and 
high-speed X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. Despite their different 
extraction behaviors, all samples show remarkably similar critical behavior with 
exponents well described by classical critical point theory consistent with the 
3D Ising model, where the critical behavior is characterized by fluctuations 
with a single diverging length scale. This unexpected result indicates a 
significant reduction in relevant chemical parameters at the critical point, 
indicating that the underlying behavior of phase transitions in LLE rely on far 
fewer variables than are generally assumed. The obtained scalar order parameter 
is attributed to the extractant fraction of the extractant/diluent mixture, 
revealing that other solution components and their respective concentrations 
simply shift the critical temperature but do not affect the nature of the 
critical fluctuations. These findings point to an opportunity to drastically 
simplify studies of liquid-liquid phase separation and phase diagram development 
in general while providing insights into LLE process improvement.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) forms biomolecular condensates or 
coacervates in cells. Metabolic enzymes can form phase-separated subcellular 
compartments that enrich enzymes, cofactors, and substrates. Herein, we report 
the construction of synthetic multienzyme condensates that catalyze the 
biosynthesis of a terpene, α-farnesene, in the prokaryote E. coli. RGGRGG 
derived from LAF-1 was used as the scaffold protein to form the condensates by 
LLPS. Multienzyme condensates were then formed by assembling two enzymes Idi and 
IspA through an RIAD/RIDD interaction. Multienzyme condensates constructed 
inside E. coli cells compartmentalized the cytosolic space into regions of high 
and low enzyme density and led to a significant enhancement of α-farnesene 
production. This work demonstrates LLPS-driven compartmentalization of the 
cytosolic space of prokaryotic cells, condensation of a biosynthetic pathway, 
and enhancement of the biosynthesis of α-farnesene.

Liquid-liquid phase separation and related phase transitions have emerged as 
generic mechanisms in living cells for the formation of membraneless 
compartments or biomolecular condensates. The surface between two immiscible 
phases has an interfacial tension, generating capillary forces that can perform 
work on the surrounding environment. Here we present the physical principles of 
capillarity, including examples of how capillary forces structure multiphase 
condensates and remodel biological substrates. As with other mechanisms of 
intracellular force generation, for example, molecular motors, capillary forces 
can influence biological processes. Identifying the biomolecular determinants of 
condensate capillarity represents an exciting frontier, bridging soft matter 
physics and cell biology.

We perform simulations of a system containing simple model proteins and a 
polymer representing chromatin. We study the interplay between protein-protein 
and protein-chromatin interactions, and the resulting condensates that arise due 
to liquid-liquid phase separation, or a via a "bridging-induced attraction" 
mechanism. For proteins that interact multivalently, we obtain a phase diagram 
which includes liquid-like droplets, droplets with absorbed polymer, and coated 
polymer regimes. Of particular interest is a regime where protein droplets only 
form due to interaction with the polymer; here, unlike a standard phase 
separating system, droplet density rather than size varies with the overall 
protein concentration. We also observe that protein dynamics within droplets 
slow down as chromatin is absorbed. If the protein-protein interactions have a 
strictly limited valence, fractal or gel-like condensates are instead observed. 
A specific example that inspired our model is heterochromatin protein 1, or HP1. 
Recent in vivo experiments have shown that HP1 exhibits similar droplet size 
buffering behavior as our simulations. Overall, our results provide biologically 
relevant insights into the general nature of protein-chromatin condensates in 
living cells.

Liquid-liquid extraction is a widely used technique of sample preparation in 
biomedical analysis. In spite of the high pre-concentration capacities of 
liquid-liquid extraction, it suffers from a number of limitations including time 
and effort consumption, large organic solvent utilization, and poor performance 
in highly polar analytes. Homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction is an alternative 
sample preparation technique that overcomes some drawbacks of conventional 
liquid-liquid extraction, and allows employing greener organic solvents in 
sample treatment. In homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction, a homogeneous phase 
is formed between the aqueous sample and the water-miscible extractant, followed 
by chemically or physically induced phase separation. To form the homogeneous 
phase, aqueous samples are mixed with water-miscible organic solvents, 
water-immiscible solvents/cosolvents, surfactants, or smart polymers. Then, 
phase separation is induced chemically (adding salt, sugar, or buffer) or 
physically (changing temperature or pH). This mode is rapid, sustainable, and 
cost-effective in comparison with other sample preparation techniques. Moreover, 
homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction is more suitable for the extraction of 
delicate macromolecules such as enzymes, hormones, and proteins and it is more 
compatible with liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, which is a 
vital technique in metabolomics and proteomics. In this review, the principle, 
types, applications, automation, and technical aspects of homogeneous 
liquid-liquid extraction are discussed.

We study the thermodynamics of binary mixtures with the volume fraction of the 
minority component less than the amount required to form a flat interface and 
show that the surface tension dominated equilibrium phase of the mixture forms a 
single macroscopic droplet. Elastic interactions in gel-polymer mixtures 
stabilize a phase with multiple droplets. Using a mean-field free energy we 
compute the droplet size as a function of the interfacial tension, Flory 
parameter, and elastic moduli of the gel. Our results illustrate the role of 
elastic interactions in dictating the phase behavior of biopolymers undergoing 
liquid-liquid phase separation.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is emerging as a major principle for the 
mesoscale organization of proteins, RNAs, and membrane-bound organelles into 
biomolecular condensates. These condensates allow for rapid cellular responses 
to changes in metabolic activities and signaling. Nowhere is this regulation 
more important than in neurons and glia, where cellular physiology occurs 
simultaneously on a range of time- and length-scales. In a number of 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), 
misregulation of biomolecular condensates leads to the formation of insoluble 
aggregates-a pathological hallmark of both sporadic and familial ALS. Here, we 
summarize how the emerging knowledge about the LLPS of ALS-related proteins 
corroborates with their aggregation. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to 
protein aggregation in ALS and how cells respond to these aggregates promises to 
open new directions for drug development.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biomolecules has emerged as a new 
paradigm in cell biology, and the process is one proposed mechanism for the 
formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs). Bacterial cells have only recently 
drawn strong interest in terms of studies on both liquid-to-liquid and 
liquid-to-solid phase transitions. It seems that these processes drive the 
formation of prokaryotic cellular condensates that resemble eukaryotic MLOs. In 
this review, we present an overview of the key microbial biomolecules that 
undergo LLPS, as well as the formation and organization of biomacromolecular 
condensates within the intracellular space. We also discuss the current 
challenges in investigating bacterial biomacromolecular condensates. 
Additionally, we highlight a summary of recent knowledge about the participation 
of bacterial biomolecules in a phase transition and provide some new in silico 
analyses that can be helpful for further investigations.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of tropoelastin has long been considered to be an 
important early step in the complex process of elastin fiber assembly in the 
body and has inspired the development of elastin-like peptides with a wide range 
of industrial and biomedical applications. Despite decades of study, the 
material state of the condensed liquid phase of elastin and its subsequent 
maturation remain poorly understood. Here, using a model minielastin that mimics 
the alternating domain structure of full-length tropoelastin, we examine the 
elastin liquid phase. We combine differential interference contrast (DIC), 
fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy with particle-tracking 
microrheology to resolve the material transition occurring within elastin 
liquids over time in the absence of exogenous cross-linking. We find that this 
transition is accompanied by an intermediate stage marked by the coexistence of 
insoluble solid and dynamic liquid phases giving rise to significant spatial 
heterogeneities in material properties. We further demonstrate that varying the 
length of the terminal hydrophobic domains of minielastins can tune the 
maturation process. This work not only resolves an important step in the 
hierarchical assembly process of elastogenesis but further contributes 
mechanistic insight into the diverse repertoire of protein condensate maturation 
pathways with emerging importance across biology.

NLRP6, a Nod-like receptor family member, has been shown to affect intestinal 
homeostasis and microbial colonization through organizing a huge protein complex 
called inflammasome. NLRP6 inflammasome promotes the cleavage and secretion of 
inflammatory cytokines or the cleavage of pore-forming Gasdermin D to initiate 
the inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis, which plays important roles in 
responding to pathogen invasion. However, questions about the ligand(s) that 
trigger NLRP6 inflammasome activation, or the mechanisms that how a ligand 
triggers NLRP6 inflammasome assembly, are emerging. In this mini-review, we 
summarize the current understandings of ligand recognition of NLRP6, the role of 
liquid-liquid phase separation in NLRP6 inflammasome assembly, and potential 
links with human health and diseases.

Coacervates droplets have long been considered as potential protocells to mimic 
living cells. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to 
coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into 
higher-order assemblies. This work shows that tyrosine-rich peptide conjugates 
can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in a well-defined pH window and 
transform into stable membrane-enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and 
cross-linking at the liquid-liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine-rich 
peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the 
coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic 
fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The 
membranes have an effective molecular weight cut-off of 2.5 kDa, as determined 
from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled peptides, RNA, and polymers into 
the membrane-enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a 
membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1kB T, which is substantially lower than 
phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness. Finally, it is shown 
that enzymes can be stably encapsulated inside the protocells and be supplied 
with substrates from outside, which opens the way for these membrane-bound 
compartments to be used as molecularly crowded artificial cells capable of 
communication or as a vehicle for drug delivery.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) often induces the formation of biomolecule 
condensates at the cellular level. The importance of this phenomenon has been 
demonstrated in many important biological functions, such as in transcription. 
However, the biophysical nature of LLPS containing transcriptional machinery has 
not yet been carefully examined. Here, we give an overview of a novel 
high-throughput single-molecule technique, termed as DNA Curtains. It was 
established recently to dissect the DNA compaction process in real time. The 
experimental procedures are further discussed in detail in the context of the 
biomolecular condensates of a transcription repressor.

Ribosome biogenesis takes place in the nucleolus, a nuclear membrane-less 
organelle. Although well studied, it remains unknown how nascent ribosomal 
subunits separate from the central chromatin compartment and move to the outer 
granular component, where maturation occurs. We find that the 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe nucleophosmin-like protein Fkbp39 localizes to rDNA 
sites encoding the 60S subunit rRNA, and this localization contributes to its 
specific association with nascent 60S subunits. Fkbp39 dissociates from 
chromatin to bind nascent 60S subunits, causing the latter to partition away 
from chromatin and from nascent 40S subunits through liquid-liquid phase 
separation. In vivo, Fkbp39 binding directs the translocation of nascent 60S 
subunits toward the nucleophosmin-rich granular component. This process 
increases the efficiency of 60S subunit assembly, facilitating the incorporation 
of 60S RNA domain III. Thus, chromatin localization determines the specificity 
of nucleophosmin in sorting nascent ribosomal subunits and coordinates their 
movement into specialized assembly compartments within the nucleolus.

In this work, a reversed-phase dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 
procedure based on the decomposition of deep eutectic solvent was suggested for 
the first time. The procedure was utilized for fast and simple separation of 
lead and cadmium from vegetable oil samples. The procedure assumed mixing of oil 
sample and DES based on menthol, formic acid and water. Water as component of 
DES promoted its decomposition in sample matrix resulting menthol dissolution in 
the sample phase and dispersion of aqueous formic acid solution. In this 
procedure menthol acted as a dispersive solvent during DES decomposition for 
dispersion of aqueous formic acid solution. The metals were determined by the 
square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. The limits of detection, were 
0.01 µg kg-1 for lead and 0.006 µg kg-1 for cadmium. The RSD was less then 6% 
for both analytes. The enrichment factor was 36 and 39 for lead and cadmium, 
respectively.

HIV integration occurs in chromatin sites that favor the release of high levels 
of viral progeny, alternatively the virus is also able to discreetly coexist 
with the host. The viral infection perturbs the cellular environment inducing 
the remodeling of the nuclear landscape. Indeed, HIV-1 triggers the nuclear 
clustering of the host factor CPSF6, but the underlying mechanism is poorly 
understood. Our data indicate that HIV usurps a recently discovered biological 
phenomenon, called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), to hijack the host 
cell. We observed CPSF6 clusters as part of HIV-induced membraneless organelles 
(HIV-1 MLOs) in macrophages, which are one of the main HIV target cells. We 
describe that HIV-1 MLOs follow phase separation rules and represent functional 
biomolecular condensates. We highlight HIV-1 MLOs as hubs of nuclear reverse 
transcription, while the double stranded viral DNA, once formed, rapidly 
migrates outside these structures. Transcription-competent proviruses localize 
outside, but near HIV-1 MLOs, in LEDGF-abundant regions, known to be active 
chromatin sites. Therefore, HIV-1 MLOs orchestrate viral events prior to the 
integration step and create a favorable environment for the viral replication. 
This study uncovers single functional host-viral complexes in their nuclear 
landscape, which is markedly restructured by HIV-1.

Biomolecular condensates are membraneless compartments formed by liquid-liquid 
phase separation. They can phase transit into gel-like and solid states. The 
amount and state of biomolecular condensates must be tightly regulated to 
maintain normal cellular function. Autophagy targets biomolecular condensates to 
the lysosome for degradation or other purposes, which we term biocondensophagy. 
In biocondensophagy, autophagy receptors recognize biomolecular condensates and 
target them to the autophagosome, the vesicle carrier of autophagy. Multiple 
types of autophagy receptors have been identified and they are specifically 
involved in targeting biomolecular condensates with different phase transition 
states. The receptors also organize the phase transition of biomolecular 
condensate to facilitate biocondensophagy. Here, we briefly discuss the latest 
discoveries regarding how biomolecular condensates are recognized by autophagy 
receptors.

Phase separation is emerging as a key mechanism to describe the formation of 
membraneless organelles in the cell. It depends on the multivalent (self-) 
interaction properties of the macromolecules involved and can be observed in 
aqueous solutions under controlled conditions in vitro with purified components. 
However, to experimentally demonstrate that this process indeed occurs in the 
complex environment of living cells remains difficult. Here, we describe an 
assay based on light-induced association of proteins into complexes termed 
optodroplets that are in the hundred nm to μm size range. The formation and 
dissociation of these optodroplets can be followed over time in living cells by 
fluorescence microscopy to evaluate the propensity of proteins to demix and to 
form phase-separated subcompartments. The optodroplet assay is based on the 
fusion of a protein of interest with the photolyase homology region (PHR) 
protein domain from Arabidopsis thaliana, which can undergo reversible 
homo-oligomerization upon illumination with blue light. Using this approach, 
candidate proteins and their interaction-deficient or interaction-enhanced 
variants can be compared to each other or to reference proteins with known phase 
separation features. By quantifying the resulting microscopy images, the 
propensity of a given protein construct to assemble into a phase-separated 
subcompartment can be assessed.

Analysis of biogenic amines (BAs) is of great importance due to their toxicity 
and usage as indicators of food freshness. In this study, membrane-assisted 
three-phase liquid-liquid extraction (MA-3pLLE) was proposed to integrate 
extraction and back-extraction into a single step using a specially designed 
U-shaped device. Parameters affecting the performance of the extraction method 
were optimized. Coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the method 
was successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of eight BAs without 
derivatization in apple juice, orange juice, red wine, soy sauce and milk 
granules, with satisfactory recoveries and RSDs. The calibration curve of the 
method was linear in the range of 1.00~100.00 ng/mL, with a correlation 
coefficient (r2) ≥ 0.9908. The limits of detection were in the range of 
0.03~1.00 ng/mL. MA-3pLLE is efficient, reproducible, and green and has great 
potential for application in the one-step extraction of analytes from complex 
matrices.

Stress granules (SGs) are non-membranous organelles facilitating stress 
responses and linking the pathology of age-related diseases. In a genome-wide 
imaging-based phenomic screen, we identify Pab1 co-localizing proteins under 
2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) induced stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find 
that deletion of one of the Pab1 co-localizing proteins, Lsm7, leads to a 
significant decrease in SG formation. Under 2-DG stress, Lsm7 rapidly forms foci 
that assist in SG formation. The Lsm7 foci form via liquid-liquid phase 
separation, and the intrinsically disordered region and the hydrophobic clusters 
within the Lsm7 sequence are the internal driving forces in promoting Lsm7 phase 
separation. The dynamic Lsm7 phase-separated condensates appear to work as 
seeding scaffolds, promoting Pab1 demixing and subsequent SG initiation, 
seemingly mediated by RNA interactions. The SG initiation mechanism, via Lsm7 
phase separation, identified in this work provides valuable clues for 
understanding the mechanisms underlying SG formation and SG-associated human 
diseases.

HYPOTHESIS: Separations of particles and cells are indispensable in many 
microfluidic systems and have numerous applications in chemistry and 
biomedicine. The interface of aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) can act as a 
liquid filter. Under electric field stimuli, the selective transfer of targets 
across the liquid-liquid interface are expected for particles and cells 
separation.
EXPERIMENTS: The separations of particles and cells based on ATPS 
electrophoresis in a microfluidic chip were investigated. A systematical study 
of the mechanism of ATPS electrophoresis was performed first by employing 
polystyrene (PS) particles. Subsequently, the separations of particles and 
microalgae cells were demonstrated.
FINDINGS: The electrophoretic transfer of particles across the interface of ATPS 
is determined by multi-parameters, including the strength of electric pulse, 
particle size, zeta potential, and hydrophobicity of the particle. The 
continuous separations of particles/cells can be achieved through the 
controllable transfer of target particles/cells across the interface under 
electric pulses in a microfluidic chip. By simply turning the magnitude of the 
applied electric pulse, the technique is suitable for different purposes, for 
example, the separations of particles and cells, purification of cells, and 
viability identification of cells. This tunable separation approach opens 
opportunities in multidimensional particle and cell sorting for the fields of 
seed selection of microorganisms, environmental assessment, and biomedical 
research.

Multivalent (specifically trivalent) metal ions are known to induce microscopic 
phase separation (commonly termed as liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)) in 
negatively charged globular proteins even at ambient temperatures, the process 
being mostly driven by protein charge neutralization followed by aggregation. 
Recent simulation studies have revealed that such self-aggregation of proteins 
is entropy driven; however, it is associated with a solvation effect, which 
could as well be different from the usual notion of hydrophobic hydration. In 
this contribution we have experimentally probed the explicit change in hydration 
associated with ion-induced LLPS formation of a globular protein bovine serum 
albumin (BSA) at ambient temperature using FIR-THz FTIR spectroscopy (50-750 
cm-1; 1.5-22.5 THz). We have used ions of different charges: Na+, K+, Ca2+, 
Mg2+, La3+, Y3+, Ho3+ and Al3+. We found that all the trivalent ions induce 
LLPS; the formation of large aggregates has been evidenced from dynamic light 
scattering (DLS) measurements, but without perturbing the protein structure as 
confirmed from circular dichroism (CD) measurements. From the frequency 
dependent absorption coefficient (α(ν)) measurements in the THz frequency domain 
we estimate the various stretching/vibrational modes of water and we found that 
ions, forming LLPS, produce definite perturbation in the overall hydration, the 
extent of which is ion specific, invoking the definite role of hydrophilic 
(electrostatic) hydration of ions in the observed LLPS process.

Scaffold proteins act as molecular hubs for the docking of multiple proteins to 
organize efficient functional units for signaling cascades. Over 300 human 
proteins have been characterized as scaffolds, acting in a variety of signaling 
pathways. While the term scaffold implies a static, supportive platform, it is 
now clear that scaffolds are not simply inert docking stations but can undergo 
conformational changes that affect their dependent signaling pathways. In this 
review, we catalog scaffold proteins that have been shown to undergo actionable 
conformational changes, with a focus on the role that conformational change 
plays in the activity of the classic yeast scaffold STE5, as well as three human 
scaffold proteins (KSR, NEMO, SHANK3) that are integral to well-known signaling 
pathways (RAS, NF-κB, postsynaptic density). We also discuss scaffold protein 
conformational changes vis-à-vis liquid-liquid phase separation. Changes in 
scaffold structure have also been implicated in human disease, and we discuss 
how aberrant conformational changes may be involved in disease-related 
dysregulation of scaffold and signaling functions. Finally, we discuss how 
understanding these conformational dynamics will provide insight into the 
flexibility of signaling cascades and may enhance our ability to treat 
scaffold-associated diseases.

Biomolecular condensates of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) such as the 
transactivation response element (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) arise 
from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and play vital roles in various 
biological processes including the formation-dissolution of stress granules 
(SGs). These condensates are thought to be directly linked to neurodegenerative 
diseases, providing a depot of aggregation-prone proteins and serving as a 
cauldron of protein aggregation and fibrillation. Despite recent research 
efforts, biochemical processes and rearrangements within biomolecular 
condensates that trigger subsequent protein misfolding and aggregation remain to 
be elucidated. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) provides a 
minimally intrusive high-sensitivity and high-resolution imaging method to 
monitor in-droplet spatiotemporal changes that initiate and lead to protein 
aggregation. In this chapter, we describe a FLIM application for characterizing 
chemical chaperone-assisted decoupling of TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation 
and aggregation/fibrillation, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies to 
combat pathological RNP-associated aggregates without compromising cellular 
stress responses.

The number of neurodegenerative diseases resulting from repeat expansion has 
increased extraordinarily in recent years. In several of these pathologies, the 
repeat can be transcribed in RNA from both DNA strands producing, at least, one 
toxic RNA repeat that causes neurodegeneration by a complex mechanism. Recently, 
seven diseases have been found caused by a novel intronic pentanucleotide repeat 
in distinct genes encoding proteins highly expressed in the cerebellum. These 
disorders are clinically heterogeneous being characterized by impaired motor 
function, resulting from ataxia or epilepsy. The role that apparently normal 
proteins from these mutant genes play in these pathologies is not known. 
However, recent advances in previously known spinocerebellar ataxias originated 
by abnormal non-coding pentanucleotide repeats point to a gain of a toxic 
function by the pathogenic repeat-containing RNA that abnormally forms nuclear 
foci with RNA-binding proteins. In cells, RNA foci have been shown to be formed 
by phase separation. Moreover, the field of repeat expansions has lately 
achieved an extraordinary progress with the discovery that RNA repeats, 
polyglutamine, and polyalanine proteins are crucial for the formation of nuclear 
membraneless organelles by phase separation, which is perturbed when they are 
expanded. This review will cover the amazing advances on repeat diseases.

Carboxysomes are large, cytosolic bodies present in all cyanobacteria and many 
proteobacteria that function as the sites of photosynthetic CO2 fixation by the 
enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The 
carboxysome lumen is enriched with Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase (CA). The 
polyhedral proteinaceous shell allows the passage of HCO3- ions into the 
carboxysome, where they are converted to CO2 by CA. Thus, the carboxysome 
functions as a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), enhancing the efficiency of 
Rubisco in CO2 fixation. In β-cyanobacteria, carboxysome biogenesis first 
involves the aggregation of Rubisco by CcmM, a scaffolding protein that exists 
in two isoforms. Both isoforms contain a minimum of three Rubisco small 
subunit-like (SSUL) domains, connected by flexible linkers. Multivalent 
interaction between these linked SSUL domains with Rubisco results in phase 
separation and condensate formation. Here, we use Rubisco and the short isoform 
of CcmM (M35) of the β-cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 to 
describe the methods used for in vitro analysis of the mechanism of condensate 
formation driven by the SSUL domains. The methods include turbidity assays, 
bright-field and fluorescence microscopy, as well as transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) in both negative staining and cryo-conditions.

Phase separation is a fundamental mechanism for compartmentalization in cells 
and leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates, generally containing 
various RNA molecules. RNAs are biomolecules that can serve as suitable 
scaffolds for biomolecular condensates and determine their forms and functions. 
Many studies have focused on biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS), one type of intracellular phase separation mechanism. 
We recently identified that paraspeckle nuclear bodies use an intracellular 
phase separation mechanism called micellization of block copolymers in their 
formation. The paraspeckles are scaffolded by NEAT1_2 long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) and their partner RNA-binding proteins (NEAT1_2 RNA-protein complexes 
[RNPs]). The NEAT1_2 RNPs act as block copolymers and the paraspeckles assemble 
through micellization. In LLPS, condensates grow without bound as long as 
components are available and typically have spherical shapes to minimize surface 
tension. In contrast, the size, shape, and internal morphology of the 
condensates are more strictly controlled in micellization. Here, we discuss the 
potential importance and future perspectives of micellization of block 
copolymers of RNPs in cells, including the construction of designer condensates 
with optimal internal organization, shape, and size according to design 
guidelines of block copolymers.

The amplitude of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is precisely controlled by the assembly 
of the cell surface-localized Wnt receptor signalosome and the cytosolic 
β-catenin destruction complex. How these two distinct complexes are coordinately 
controlled remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that the signalosome 
scaffold protein Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS). Dvl2 LLPS is mediated by an intrinsically disordered region and 
facilitated by components of the signalosome, such as the receptor Fzd5. 
Assembly of the signalosome is initiated by rapid recruitment of Dvl2 to the 
membrane, followed by slow and dynamic recruitment of Axin1. Axin LLPS mediates 
assembly of the β-catenin destruction complex, and Dvl2 attenuates LLPS of Axin. 
Compared with the destruction complex, Axin partitions into the signalosome at a 
lower concentration and exhibits a higher mobility. Together, our results 
revealed that Dvl2 LLPS is crucial for controlling the assembly of the Wnt 
receptor signalosome and disruption of the phase-separated β-catenin destruction 
complex.

Biomolecular condensates are nonmembrane cellular compartments whose formation 
in many cases involves phase separation (PS). Despite much research interest in 
this mechanism of macromolecular self-organization, the concept of PS as applied 
to a live cell faces certain challenges. In this review, we discuss a basic 
model of PS and the role of site-specific interactions and percolation in 
cellular PS-related events. Using a multivalent poly(ADP-ribose) molecule as an 
example, which has high PS-driving potential due to its structural features, we 
consider how site-specific interactions and network formation are involved in 
the formation of phase-separated cellular condensates.

The limited options for treating patients with drug-resistant cancers have 
emphasized the need to identify alternative treatment targets. Tumor cells have 
large super-enhancers (SEs) in the vicinity of important oncogenes for 
activation. The physical process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
contributes to the assembly of several membrane-less organelles in mammalian 
cells. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins induce LLPS formation 
by developing condensates. It was discovered that key transcription factors 
(TFs) undergo LLPS in SEs. In addition, TFs play critical roles in the 
epigenetic and genetic regulation of cancer progression. Recently, we revealed 
the essential role of disease-specific TF collaboration changes in advanced 
prostate cancer (PC). OCT4 confers epigenetic changes by promoting complex 
formation with TFs, such as Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), androgen receptor 
(AR) and Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), inducing PC progression. It was 
demonstrated that TF collaboration through LLPS underlying transcriptional 
activation contributes to cancer aggressiveness and drug resistance. Moreover, 
the disruption of TF-mediated LLPS inhibited treatment-resistant PC tumor 
growth. Therefore, we propose that repression of TF collaborations involved in 
the LLPS of SEs could be a promising strategy for advanced cancer therapy. In 
this article, we summarize recent evidence highlighting the formation of LLPS on 
enhancers as a potent therapeutic target in advanced cancers.

In the last years, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been highlighted for their 
capacity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Aberrant phase 
transitions of RBPs from a liquid to a solid state are believed to underlie the 
formation of pathological RBP aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases. 
Both in the physiological and the disease state, RBPs are often decorated with 
diverse posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that can influence the phase 
separation behavior, the physiological function, and the pathological behavior 
of the RBP. Here we describe two simple methods, sedimentation assays in vitro 
and in cells, that allow the analysis of RBP solubility as a measure of RBP 
phase separation in the absence or presence of a certain PTM.

Recent technological advances allow us to resolve molecular processes in living 
cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. Based on these technological 
advances, membraneless intracellular condensates formed by reversible functional 
aggregation and phase separation have been identified as important regulatory 
modules in diverse biological processes. Here, we present bioinformatic and 
cellular studies highlighting the possibility of the involvement of the central 
activator of ethylene responses EIN2 in such cellular condensates and phase 
separation processes. Our work provides insight into the molecular type 
(identity) of the observed EIN2 condensates and on potential intrinsic elements 
and sequence motifs in EIN2-C that may regulate condensate formation and 
dynamics.

Liquid-liquid phase separation driven by weak interactions between multivalent 
molecules contributes to the cellular organization by promoting the formation of 
biomolecular condensates. At membranes, phase separation can promote the 
assembly of transmembrane proteins with their cytoplasmic binding partners into 
micron-sized membrane-associated condensates. For example, phase separation 
promotes clustering of nephrin, a transmembrane adhesion molecule, resulting in 
increased Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization. In vitro reconstitution 
is a powerful approach to understand phase separation in biological systems. 
With a bottom-up approach, we can determine the molecules necessary and 
sufficient for phase separation, map the phase diagram by quantifying de-mixing 
over a range of molecular concentrations, assess the material properties of the 
condensed phase using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and 
even determine how phase separation impacts downstream biochemical activity. 
Here, we describe a detailed protocol to reconstitute nephrin clusters on 
supported lipid bilayers with purified recombinant protein. We also describe how 
to measure Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization on bilayers using 
fluorescence microscopy. These different protocols can be performed 
independently or combined as needed. These general techniques can be applied to 
reconstitute and study phase-separated signaling clusters of many different 
receptors or to generally understand how actin polymerization is regulated at 
membranes.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an important mechanism that mediates 
the formation of biomolecular condensates. Despite the immense interest in LLPS, 
phase-separated proteins verified by experiments are still limited, and 
identification of phase-separated proteins at proteome-scale is a challenging 
task. Multivalent interaction among macromolecules is the driving force of LLPS, 
which suggests that phase-separated proteins may harbor distinct biological 
characteristics in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In this study, we 
constructed an integrated human PPI network (HPIN) and mapped phase-separated 
proteins into it. Analysis of the network parameters revealed differences of 
network topology between phase-separated proteins and others. The results 
further suggested the efficiency when applying topological similarities in 
distinguishing components of MLOs. Furthermore, we found that affinity 
purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) detects PPIs more effectively than 
yeast-two hybrid system (Y2H) in phase separation-driven condensates. Our work 
provides the first global view of the distinct network topology of 
phase-separated proteins in human interactome, suggesting incorporation of PPI 
network for LLPS prediction in further studies.

We model the environment of eukaryotic nuclei by representing macromolecules by 
only their entropic properties, with globular molecules represented by spherical 
colloids and flexible molecules by polymers. We put particular focus on proteins 
with both globular and intrinsically disordered regions, which we represent with 
'tadpole' constructed by grafting single polymers and colloids together. In 
Monte Carlo simulations, we find these tadpoles support phase separation via 
depletion flocculation, and demonstrate several surfactant behaviours, including 
being found preferentially at interfaces and forming micelles in single phase 
solution. Furthermore, the model parameters can be tuned to give a tadpole a 
preference for either bulk phase. However, we find entropy too weak to drive 
these behaviours by itself at likely biological concentrations.

A vast number of intracellular membraneless bodies also known as biomolecular 
condensates form through a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of 
biomolecules. To date, phase separation has been identified as the main driving 
force for a membraneless organelles such as nucleoli, Cajal bodies, stress 
granules, and chromatin compartments. Recently, the protein-RNA condensation is 
receiving increased attention, because it is closely related to the biological 
function of cells such as transcription, translation, and RNA metabolism. 
Despite the multidisciplinary efforts put forth to study the biophysical 
properties of protein-RNA condensates, there are many fundamental unanswered 
questions regarding the mechanism of formation and regulation of protein-RNA 
condensates in eukaryotic cells. Major challenges in studying protein-RNA 
condensation stem from (i) the molecular heterogeneity and conformational 
flexibility of RNA and protein chains and (ii) the nonequilibrium nature of 
transcription and cellular environment. Computer simulations, bioinformatics, 
and mathematical models are uniquely positioned for shedding light on the 
microscopic nature of protein-RNA phase separation. To this end, there is an 
urgent need for innovative models with the right spatiotemporal resolution for 
confronting the experimental observables in a comprehensive and physics-based 
manner. In this chapter, we will summarize the currently emerging research 
efforts, which employ atomistic and coarse-grained molecular models and field 
theoretical models to understand equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of 
protein-RNA condensation.

Paralogs, arising from gene duplications, increase the functional diversity of 
proteins. Protein functions in paralog families have been extensively studied, 
but little is known about the roles that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) 
play in their paralogs. Without a folded structure to restrain them, IDRs mutate 
more diversely along with evolution. However, how the diversity of IDRs in a 
paralog family affects their functions is unexplored. Using the RNA-binding 
protein Musashi family as an example, we applied multiple structural techniques 
and phylogenetic analysis to show how members in a paralog family have evolved 
their IDRs to different physicochemical properties but converge to the same 
function. In this example, the lower prion-like tendency of Musashi-1's IDRs, 
rather than Musashi-2's, is compensated by its higher α-helical propensity to 
assist their assembly. Our work suggests that, no matter how diverse they 
become, IDRs could evolve different traits to a converged function, such as 
liquid-liquid phase separation.

In amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) 
is dissolved on a molecular level in a polymeric matrix. The API is expected to 
be released from the ASD upon dissolution in aqueous media. However, a series of 
earlier works observed a drastic collapse of the API release for ASDs with high 
drug loads (DLs) compared to those with low DLs. This work provides a 
thermodynamic analysis of the release mechanism of ASDs composed of ritonavir 
(RIT) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVPVA). The observed release 
behavior is, for the first time, explained based on the quantitative 
thermodynamic phase diagram predicted by PC-SAFT. Both liquid-liquid phase 
separation in the dissolution medium, as well as amorphous phase separation in 
the ASD, could be linked back to the same thermodynamic origin, whereas they had 
been understood as different phenomena so far in the literature. Furthermore, it 
is illustrated that upon release, independent of DL, both phenomena occur 
simultaneously for the investigated system. It could be shown that the 
non-congruent release of the drug and polymer is observed when amorphous phase 
separation within the ASD has taken place to some degree prior to dissolution. 
Nanodroplet formation in the dissolution medium could be explained as the 
liquid-liquid phase separation, as predicted by PC-SAFT.

Biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation enable 
spatial and temporal organization of enzyme activity. Phase separation in many 
eukaryotic condensates has been shown to be responsive to intracellular 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, although the consequences of these 
mechanisms for enzymes sequestered within the condensates are unknown. Here, we 
show that ATP depletion promotes phase separation in bacterial condensates 
composed of intrinsically disordered proteins. Enhanced phase separation 
promotes the sequestration and activity of a client kinase enabling robust 
signaling and maintenance of viability under the stress posed by nutrient 
scarcity. We propose that a diverse repertoire of condensates can serve as 
control knobs to tune enzyme sequestration and reactivity in response to the 
metabolic state of bacterial cells.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease are caused 
by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) proteins. LLPS is a phenomenon in which 
a dense liquid phase of proteins is formed in a liquid phase in which proteins 
are dispersed at a low concentration. The concentrated proteins enable highly 
efficient chemical reactions, but at the same time, there is a risk of forming 
insoluble aggregates that cause diseases. In fact, neurodegenerative 
disease-related proteins form insoluble aggregates, which cause great damage to 
nerves, resulting in memory and motor disorders. Drug discovery requires the 
design of drug candidates that can strongly bind to the intrinsically disordered 
region of a phase-separated protein and control the phase-separated state. This 
paper mainly introduces our research on peptide design that binds to 
phase-separated proteins. For peptide drug discovery, it is necessary to 
efficiently search for drug candidates among a huge number of peptides. As an 
efficient search method for peptides that control phase-separated proteins, we 
searched for amino acids that can control liquid-liquid phase separation, and 
devised a method for designing peptides containing effective amino acids. It was 
demonstrated that this method can be used to control the LLPS and solid 
aggregate formation of the neurodegenerative disease-related protein FUS. 
Furthermore, we devised a method for rationally designing a peptide that binds 
complementarily to the intrinsically disordered region of the target, and 
demonstrated the functional control of the cancer disease-related protein p53. 
Finally, we discuss the possibility of peptide drug discovery for 
disease-related LLPS proteins.

Liquid-liquid phase separation drives the formation of biological condensates 
that play essential roles in transcriptional regulation and signal sensing. 
Computational modeling could provide high-resolution structural 
characterizations of these condensates and help uncover physicochemical 
interactions that dictate their stability. However, many protein molecules 
involved in phase separation often contain multiple ordered domains connected 
with flexible, structureless linkers. Simulating such proteins necessitates 
force fields with consistent accuracy for both folded and disordered proteins. 
We provide a critical review of existing coarse-grained force fields for 
disordered proteins and highlight the challenges in their application to folded 
proteins. After discussing existing algorithms for force field parameterization, 
we propose an optimization strategy that should lead to computer models with 
improved transferability across protein types.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid 
protein is an essential structural component of mature virions, encapsulating 
the genomic RNA and modulating RNA transcription and replication. Several of its 
activities might be associated with the protein's ability to undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation. NSARS-CoV-2 contains an intrinsically disordered 
region at its N-terminus (NTE) that can be phosphorylated and is affected by 
mutations found in human COVID-19 infections, including in the Omicron variant 
of concern. Here, we show that NTE deletion decreases the range of RNA 
concentrations that can induce phase separation of NSARS-CoV-2 . In addition, 
deletion of the prion-like NTE allows NSARS-CoV-2 droplets to retain their 
liquid-like nature during incubation. We further demonstrate that RNA-binding 
engages multiple parts of the NTE and changes NTE's structural properties. The 
results form the foundation to characterize the impact of N-terminal mutations 
and post-translational modifications on the molecular properties of the 
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. STATEMENT: The nucleocapsid protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in both genome packaging and viral 
replication upon host infection. Replication has been associated with 
RNA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein. We 
present insights into the role of the N-terminal part of the nucleocapsid 
protein in the protein's RNA-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation.

For the first time, self-standing microfiltration (MF) hollow fiber membranes 
were prepared from cellulose triacetate (CTA) via the thermally induced phase 
separation (TIPS) method. The resultant membranes were compared with 
counterparts prepared from cellulose diacetate (CDA) and cellulose acetate 
propionate (CAP). Extensive solvent screening by considering the Hansen 
solubility parameters of the polymer and solvent, the polymer's solubility at 
high temperature, solidification of the polymer solution at low temperature, 
viscosity, and processability of the polymeric solution, is the most challenging 
issue for cellulose membrane preparation. Different phase separation mechanisms 
were identified for CTA, CDA, and CAP polymer solutions prepared using the 
screened solvents for membrane preparation. CTA solutions in binary organic 
solvents possessed the appropriate properties for membrane preparation via 
liquid-liquid phase separation, followed by a solid-liquid phase separation 
(polymer crystallization) mechanism. For the prepared CTA hollow fiber 
membranes, the maximum stress was 3-5 times higher than those of the CDA and CAP 
membranes. The temperature gap between the cloud point and crystallization onset 
in the polymer solution plays a crucial role in membrane formation. All of the 
CTA, CDA, and CAP membranes had a very porous bulk structure with a pore size of 
∼100 nm or larger, as well as pores several hundred nanometers in size at the 
inner surface. Using an air gap distance of 0 mm, the appropriate organic 
solvents mixed in an optimized ratio, and a solvent for cellulose derivatives as 
the quench bath media, it was possible to obtain a CTA MF hollow fiber membrane 
with high pure water permeance and notably high rejection of 100 nm silica 
nanoparticles. It is expected that these membranes can play a great role in 
pharmaceutical separation.

SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing the ongoing pandemic with > 460 millions 
of infections and > 6 millions of deaths. SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) is the 
only structural protein which plays essential roles in almost all key steps of 
the viral life cycle with its diverse functions depending on liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) driven by interacting with various nucleic acids. The 
419-residue N protein is highly conserved in all variants including delta and 
omicron, and composed of both folded N-/C-terminal domains (NTD/CTD) as well as 
three long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Recent results have 
suggested that its CTD and IDRs are also cryptic nucleic acid-binding domains. 
In this context, any small molecules capable of interfering in its interaction 
with nucleic acids are anticipated to modulate its LLPS and associated 
functions. Indeed, ATP, the energy currency existing at very high concentrations 
(2-12 mM) in all living cells but absent in viruses, modulates LLPS of N 
protein, and consequently appears to be evolutionarily hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 to 
promote its life cycle. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been also shown to 
specifically bind NTD and CTD to inhibit their interactions with nucleic acids, 
as well as to disrupt LLPS. Particularly, the unique structure of the HCQ-CTD 
complex offers a promising strategy for further design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs 
with better affinity and specificity. The finding may indicate that LLPS is 
indeed druggable by small molecules, thus opening up a promising direction for 
drug discovery/design by targeting LLPS in general.

Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure plays a critical role in development, 
gene regulation, and cellular identity. Alterations to this structure can have 
profound effects on cellular phenotypes and have been associated with a variety 
of diseases including multiple types of cancer. One of several forces that help 
shape 3D chromatin structure is liquid-liquid phase separation, a form of 
self-association between biomolecules that can sequester regions of chromatin 
into subnuclear droplets or even membraneless organelles like nucleoli. This 
review focuses on a class of oncogenic fusion proteins that appear to exert 
their oncogenic function via phase-separation-driven alterations to 3D chromatin 
structure. Here, we review what is known about the mechanisms by which these 
oncogenic fusion proteins phase separate in the nucleus and their role in 
shaping the 3D chromatin structure. We discuss the potential for this phenomenon 
to be a more widespread mechanism of oncogenesis.

Biomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles (MLOs) that are enriched in 
specific proteins and nucleic acids, compartmentalized to perform biochemical 
functions. Such condensates are formed by phase separation (PS) enabled by 
protein domains that allow multivalent interactions. Chromosomal 
translocation-derived in-frame gene fusions often generate proteins with 
non-native domain combinations that rewire protein-protein interaction networks. 
Several recent studies have shown that, for a subset of these fusion proteins, 
pathogenesis can be driven by the ability of the fusion protein to undergo phase 
transitions at non-physiological cellular locations to form ectopic condensates. 
We highlight how such ectopic phase transitions can alter biological processes 
and posit that dysfunction via protein PS at non-physiological locations 
represents a generic route to oncogenic transformation.

Biomolecular condensates organize cellular functions in the absence of 
membranes. These membraneless organelles can form through liquid-liquid phase 
separation coalescing RNA and proteins into well-defined, yet dynamic, 
structures distinct from the surrounding cellular milieu. Numerous physiological 
and disease-causing processes link to biomolecular condensates, which could 
impact drug discovery in several ways. First, disruption of pathological 
condensates seeded by mutated proteins or RNAs may provide new opportunities to 
treat disease. Second, condensates may be leveraged to tackle difficult-to-drug 
targets lacking binding pockets whose function depends on phase separation. 
Third, condensate-resident small molecules and RNA therapeutics may display 
unexpected pharmacology. We discuss the potential impact of phase separation on 
drug discovery and RNA therapeutics, leveraging concrete examples, towards novel 
clinical opportunities.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) effect biological function despite 
their sequence-encoded lack of preference for stable three-dimensional 
structure. Among their many functions, IDPs form membraneless cellular 
compartments through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), also termed 
biomolecular condensation. The extent to which LLPS has been evolutionarily 
selected remains largely unknown, as the complexities of IDP evolution hamper 
progress. Unlike structured proteins, rapid sequence divergence typical of IDPs 
confounds inference of their biophysical or biological functions from 
comparative sequence analyses. Here, we leverage mitosis as a universal 
eukaryotic feature to interrogate condensate evolutionary history. We observe 
that evolution has conserved the ability for six homologs of the mitotic IDP 
BuGZ to undergo LLPS and to serve the same mitotic function, despite low 
sequence conservation. We also observe that cellular context may tune LLPS. The 
phylogenetic correlation of LLPS and mitotic function in one protein raises the 
possibility of an ancient evolutionary interplay between LLPS and biological 
function, dating back at least 1.6 billion years to the last common ancestor of 
plants and animals.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. In 
recent years, a large number of ALS-related mutations have been discovered to 
have a strong link to stress granules (SGs). SGs are cytoplasmic 
ribonucleoprotein condensates mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
of biomacromolecules. They help cells cope with stress. The normal physiological 
functions of SGs are dependent on three key aspects of SG "homeostasis": SG 
assembly, disassembly, and SG components. Any of these three aspects can be 
disrupted, resulting in abnormalities in the cellular stress response and 
leading to cytotoxicity. Several ALS-related pathogenic mutants have abnormal 
LLPS abilities that disrupt SG homeostasis, and some of them can even cause 
aberrant phase transitions. As a result, ALS-related mutants may disrupt various 
aspects of SG homeostasis by directly disturbing the intermolecular interactions 
or affecting core SG components, thus disrupting the phase equilibrium of the 
cytoplasm during stress. Considering that the importance of the "global view" of 
SG homeostasis in ALS pathogenesis has not received enough attention, we first 
systematically summarize the physiological regulatory mechanism of SG 
homeostasis based on LLPS and then examine ALS pathogenesis from the perspective 
of disrupted SG homeostasis and aberrant phase transition of biomacromolecules.

The discovery of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that do not have an 
ordered structure and nevertheless perform essential functions has opened a new 
era in the understanding of cellular compartmentalization. It threw the bridge 
from the mostly mechanistic model of the organization of the living matter to 
the idea of highly dynamic and functional "soft matter". This paradigm is based 
on the notion of the major role of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of 
biopolymers in the spatial-temporal organization of intracellular space. The 
LLPS leads to the formation of self-assembled membrane-less organelles (MLOs). 
MLOs are multicomponent and multifunctional biological condensates, highly 
dynamic in structure and composition, that allow them to fine-tune the 
regulation of various intracellular processes. IDPs play a central role in the 
assembly and functioning of MLOs. The LLPS importance for the regulation of 
chemical reactions inside the cell is clearly illustrated by the reorganization 
of the intracellular space during stress response. As a reaction to various 
types of stresses, stress-induced MLOs appear in the cell, enabling the 
preservation of the genetic and protein material during unfavourable conditions. 
In addition, stress causes structural, functional, and compositional changes in 
the MLOs permanently present inside the cells. In this review, we describe the 
assembly of stress-induced MLOs and the stress-induced modification of existing 
MLOs in eukaryotes, yeasts, and prokaryotes in response to various stress 
factors.

Melatonin: Regulation of Viral Phase Separation and Epitranscriptomics in 
Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19.

The relentless, protracted evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus imposes tremendous 
pressure on herd immunity and demands versatile adaptations by the human host 
genome to counter transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic alterations associated 
with a wide range of short- and long-term manifestations during acute infection 
and post-acute recovery, respectively. To promote viral replication during 
active infection and viral persistence, the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein 
regulates host cell microenvironment including pH and ion concentrations to 
maintain a high oxidative environment that supports template switching, causing 
extensive mitochondrial damage and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine 
signaling cascades. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial distress induce dynamic 
changes to both the host and viral RNA m6A methylome, and can trigger the 
derepression of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1), resulting in global 
hypomethylation, epigenetic changes, and genomic instability. The timely 
application of melatonin during early infection enhances host innate antiviral 
immune responses by preventing the formation of "viral factories" by 
nucleocapsid liquid-liquid phase separation that effectively blockades viral 
genome transcription and packaging, the disassembly of stress granules, and the 
sequestration of DEAD-box RNA helicases, including DDX3X, vital to immune 
signaling. Melatonin prevents membrane depolarization and protects cristae 
morphology to suppress glycolysis via antioxidant-dependent and -independent 
mechanisms. By restraining the derepression of LINE1 via multifaceted 
strategies, and maintaining the balance in m6A RNA modifications, melatonin 
could be the quintessential ancient molecule that significantly influences the 
outcome of the constant struggle between virus and host to gain transcriptomic 
and epitranscriptomic dominance over the host genome during acute infection and 
PASC.

University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with a low-complexity prion-like domain (PLD) can 
undergo aberrant phase transitions and have been implicated in neurodegenerative 
diseases such as ALS and FTD. Several nuclear RBPs mislocalize to cytoplasmic 
inclusions in disease conditions. Impairment in nucleocytoplasmic transport is 
another major event observed in ageing and in neurodegenerative disorders. 
Nuclear import receptors (NIRs) regulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of 
different RBPs bearing a nuclear localization signal by restoring their nuclear 
localization. NIRs can also specifically dissolve or prevent the aggregation and 
liquid-liquid phase separation of wild-type or disease-linked mutant RBPs, due 
to their chaperoning activity. This review focuses on the LLPS of intrinsically 
disordered proteins and the role of NIRs in regulating LLPS in 
neurodegeneration. This review also discusses the implication of NIRs as 
therapeutic agents in neurogenerative diseases.

The interior of the eukaryotic cell nucleus has a crowded and heterogeneous 
environment packed with chromatin polymers, regulatory proteins, and RNA 
molecules. Chromatin polymer, assisted by epigenetic modifications, protein and 
RNA binders, forms multi-scale compartments which help regulate genes in 
response to cellular signals. Furthermore, chromatin compartments are dynamic 
and tend to evolve in size and composition in ways that are not fully 
understood. The latest super-resolution imaging experiments have revealed a much 
more dynamic and stochastic nature of chromatin compartments than was 
appreciated before. An emerging mechanism explaining chromatin 
compartmentalization dynamics is the phase separation of protein and nucleic 
acids into membraneless liquid condensates. Consequently, concepts and ideas 
from soft matter and polymer systems have been rapidly entering the lexicon of 
cell biology. In this respect, the role of computational models is crucial for 
establishing a rigorous and quantitative foundation for the new concepts and 
disentangling the complex interplay of forces that contribute to the emergent 
patterns of chromatin dynamics and organization. Several multi-scale models have 
emerged to address various aspects of chromatin dynamics, ranging from 
equilibrium polymer simulations, hybrid non-equilibrium simulations coupling 
protein binding and chromatin folding, and mesoscopic field-theoretic models. 
Here, we review these emerging theoretical paradigms and computational models 
with a particular focus on chromatin's phase separation and liquid-like 
properties as a basis for nuclear organization and dynamics.

A combination of modified quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe extraction 
approach with carbon nano-onions-based dispersive solid-phase extraction and 
dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction was developed for the extraction of 
several pesticides (diazinon, chlorpyrifos, tebuconazole, deltamethrin, 
permethrin, haloxyfop-methyl, penconazole, and cyhalothrin) from grape before 
their analysis by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. In the 
extraction approach, an aliquot of grape sample is chopped and after separating 
its juice, the pesticides that remained in the refuse are extracted by the 
quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction method. The obtained 
acetonitrile phase is mixed with juice and the analytes are extracted by the 
carbon nano-onions-based dispersive solid-phase extraction. The analytes are 
concentrated using the microextraction procedure to obtain high enrichment 
factors. The results showed low limits of detection (0.5-1.6 ng/g) and 
quantification (1.8-5.4 ng/g) with satisfactory linearity of the calibration 
curves (determination coefficient, r2 ≥ 0.994). The precision of the developed 
method expressed as relative standard deviations was good (≤7.2%). The method 
provided high enrichment factors (350-410) and extraction recoveries (70-82%). 
Finally, seven grape samples were analyzed successfully.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a biological phenomenon wherein a 
metastable and concentrated droplet phase of biomolecules spontaneously forms. A 
link may exist between LLPS of proteins and the disease-related process of 
amyloid fibril formation; however, this connection is not fully understood. 
Here, we investigated the relationship between LLPS and aggregation of the 
C-terminal domain of TAR DNA-binding protein 43, an amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis-related protein known to both phase separate and form amyloids, by 
monitoring conformational changes during droplet aging using Raman spectroscopy. 
We found that the earliest aggregation events occurred within droplets as 
indicated by the development of β-sheet structure and increased thioflavin-T 
emission. Interestingly, filamentous aggregates appeared outside the solidified 
droplets at a later time, suggestive that amyloid formation is a heterogeneous 
process under LLPS solution conditions. Furthermore, the secondary structure 
content of aggregated structures inside droplets is distinct from that in de 
novo fibrils, implying that fibril polymorphism develops as a result of 
different environments (LLPS versus bulk solution), which may have pathological 
significance.

Molecular optogenetics is a highly dynamic research field. In the past two 
years, the field was characterized by the development of new allosteric switches 
as well as the forward integration of optogenetics research towards application. 
Further, two areas of research have significantly gathered momentum, the use of 
optogenetics to control liquid-liquid phase separation as well as the 
application of optogenetic tools in the extracellular space. Here, we review 
these areas and discuss future directions.

Melatonin: Regulation of Prion Protein Phase Separation in Cancer Multidrug

The unique ability to adapt and thrive in inhospitable, stressful tumor 
microenvironments (TME) also renders cancer cells resistant to traditional 
chemotherapeutic treatments and/or novel pharmaceuticals. Cancer cells exhibit 
extensive metabolic alterations involving hypoxia, accelerated glycolysis, 
oxidative stress, and increased extracellular ATP that may activate ancient, 
conserved prion adaptive response strategies that exacerbate multidrug 
resistance (MDR) by exploiting cellular stress to increase cancer metastatic 
potential and stemness, balance proliferation and differentiation, and amplify 
resistance to apoptosis. The regulation of prions in MDR is further complicated 
by important, putative physiological functions of ligand-binding and signal 
transduction. Melatonin is capable of both enhancing physiological functions and 
inhibiting oncogenic properties of prion proteins. Through regulation of phase 
separation of the prion N-terminal domain which targets and interacts with lipid 
rafts, melatonin may prevent conformational changes that can result in 
aggregation and/or conversion to pathological, infectious isoforms. As a cancer 
therapy adjuvant, melatonin could modulate TME oxidative stress levels and 
hypoxia, reverse pH gradient changes, reduce lipid peroxidation, and protect 
lipid raft compositions to suppress prion-mediated, non-Mendelian, heritable, 
but often reversible epigenetic adaptations that facilitate cancer 
heterogeneity, stemness, metastasis, and drug resistance. This review examines 
some of the mechanisms that may balance physiological and pathological effects 
of prions and prion-like proteins achieved through the synergistic use of 
melatonin to ameliorate MDR, which remains a challenge in cancer treatment.

Ultrafiltration membranes are important porous materials to produce freshwater 
in an increasingly water-scarce world. A recent approach to generate porous 
membranes is solvent transfer induced phase separation (STrIPS). During STrIPS, 
the interplay of liquid-liquid phase separation and nanoparticle self-assembly 
results in hollow fibers with small surface pores, ideal structures for 
applications as filtration membranes. However, the underlying mechanisms of the 
membrane formation are still poorly understood, limiting the control over 
structure and properties. To address this knowledge gap, we study the 
nonequilibrium dynamics of hollow fiber structure evolution. Confocal microscopy 
reveals the distribution of nanoparticles and monomers during STrIPS. Diffusion 
simulations are combined with measurements of the interfacial elasticity to 
investigate the effect of the solvent concentration on nanoparticle 
stabilization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the separation performance of the 
membrane during ultrafiltration. To this end, polyelectrolyte multilayers are 
deposited on the membrane, leading to tunable pores that enable the removal of 
dextran molecules of different molecular weights (>360 kDa, >60 kDa, >18 kDa) 
from a feed water stream. The resulting understanding of STrIPS and the 
simplicity of the synthesis process open avenues to design novel membranes for 
advanced separation applications.

The assembly of complexes following the detection of extracellular signals is 
often controlled by signaling proteins comprising multiple peptide binding 
modules. The SRC homology (SH)3 family represents the archetypical modular 
protein interaction module, with ~300 annotated SH3 domains in humans that 
regulate an impressive array of signaling processes. We review recent findings 
regarding the allosteric contributions of SH3 domains host protein context, 
their phosphoregulation, and their roles in phase separation that challenge the 
simple model in which SH3s are considered to be portable domains binding to 
specific proline-rich peptide motifs.

Cells contain membraneless compartments that assemble due to liquid-liquid phase 
separation, including biomolecular condensates with complex morphologies. For 
instance, certain condensates are surrounded by a film of distinct composition, 
such as Ape1 condensates coated by a layer of Atg19, required for selective 
autophagy in yeast. Other condensates are multiphasic, with nested liquid phases 
of distinct compositions and functions, such as in the case of ribosome 
biogenesis in the nucleolus. The size and structure of such condensates must be 
regulated for proper biological function. We leveraged a bioinspired approach to 
discover how amphiphilic, surfactant-like proteins may contribute to the 
structure and size regulation of biomolecular condensates. We designed and 
examined families of amphiphilic proteins comprising one phase-separating domain 
and one non-phase-separating domain. In particular, these proteins contain the 
soluble structured domain glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose binding 
protein (MBP), fused to the intrinsically disordered RGG domain from P granule 
protein LAF-1. When one amphiphilic protein is mixed in vitro with RGG-RGG, the 
proteins assemble into enveloped condensates, with RGG-RGG at the core and the 
amphiphilic protein forming the surface film layer. Importantly, we found that 
MBP-based amphiphiles are surfactants and influence droplet size, with 
increasing surfactant concentration resulting in smaller droplet radii. In 
contrast, GST-based amphiphiles at increased concentrations coassemble with 
RGG-RGG into multiphasic structures. We propose a mechanism for these 
experimental observations, supported by molecular simulations of a minimalist 
model. We speculate that surfactant proteins may play a significant role in 
regulating the structure and function of biomolecular condensates.

Expanded short tandem repeats in the genome cause various monogenic diseases, 
particularly neurological disorders. Since the discovery of a CGG repeat 
expansion in the FMR1 gene in 1991, more than 40 repeat expansion diseases have 
been identified to date. In the coding repeat expansion diseases, in which the 
expanded repeat sequence is located in the coding regions of genes, the toxicity 
of repeat polypeptides, particularly misfolding and aggregation of proteins 
containing an expanded polyglutamine tract, have been the focus of 
investigation. On the other hand, in the non-coding repeat expansion diseases, 
in which the expanded repeat sequence is located in introns or untranslated 
regions, the toxicity of repeat RNAs has been the focus of investigation. 
Recently, these repeat RNAs were demonstrated to be translated into repeat 
polypeptides by the novel mechanism of repeat-associated non-AUG translation, 
which has extended the research direction of the pathological mechanisms of this 
disease entity to include polypeptide toxicity. Thus, a common pathogenesis has 
been suggested for both coding and non-coding repeat expansion diseases. In this 
review, we briefly outline the major pathogenic mechanisms of repeat expansion 
diseases, including a loss-of-function mechanism caused by repeat expansion, 
repeat RNA toxicity caused by RNA foci formation and protein sequestration, and 
toxicity by repeat polypeptides. We also discuss perturbation of the 
physiological liquid-liquid phase separation state caused by these repeat RNAs 
and repeat polypeptides, as well as potential therapeutic approaches against 
repeat expansion diseases.

Growing evidence indicates that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a 
phenomenon whereby transient, weak interactions can facilitate self-assembly of 
proteins into liquid-like droplets and can contribute to the formation of 
amyloid fibrils. Such an observation has posited that LLPS and the associated 
formation of membrane-less organelles in the cell can contribute to protein 
aggregation in neurodegenerative disease. In this chapter, we describe methods 
for performing biophysical studies on the transactive response DNA-binding 
protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), a protein that forms aggregates in amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We describe 
purification of the disordered low-complexity domain (LCD) of TDP-43 and provide 
a methodology for studying the protein's behavior using site-directed spin 
labeling coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance. We additionally discuss 
visualization of TDP-43 LCD liquid droplets and methods for quantifying LLPS and 
aggregation into amyloid fibrils.

Ubiquitin-binding shuttle UBQLN2 mediates crosstalk between proteasomal 
degradation and autophagy, likely via interactions with K48- and K63-linked 
polyubiquitin chains, respectively. UBQLN2 comprises self-associating regions 
that drive its homotypic liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Specific 
interactions between one of these regions and ubiquitin inhibit UBQLN2 LLPS. 
Here, we show that, unlike ubiquitin, the effects of multivalent polyubiquitin 
chains on UBQLN2 LLPS are highly dependent on chain types. Specifically, K11-Ub4 
and K48-Ub4 chains generally inhibit UBQLN2 LLPS, whereas K63-Ub4, M1-Ub4 
chains, and a designed tetrameric ubiquitin construct significantly enhance 
LLPS. We demonstrate that these opposing effects stem from differences in chain 
conformations but not in affinities between chains and UBQLN2. Chains with 
extended conformations and increased accessibility to the ubiquitin-binding 
surface promote UBQLN2 LLPS by enabling a switch between homotypic to partially 
heterotypic LLPS that is driven by both UBQLN2 self-interactions and 
interactions between multiple UBQLN2 units with each polyubiquitin chain. Our 
study provides mechanistic insights into how the structural and conformational 
properties of polyubiquitin chains contribute to heterotypic LLPS with 
ubiquitin-binding shuttles and adaptors.

Protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been associated with 
biological functions and pathological aggregation. Mapping the phase separation 
conditions is the first step to identify and quantify the driving forces of 
LLPS. Here, we describe the protocols to draw the phase diagram of tau-RNA LLPS 
and use the mapped diagram to guide experimental conditions for LLPS-cell 
coculturing, electron resonance spectroscopy in particular double 
electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, crosslinking immunoprecipitation, and 
isothermal titration calorimetry.

Motions in biomolecules are critical for biochemical reactions. In cells, many 
biochemical reactions are executed inside of biomolecular condensates formed by 
ultradynamic intrinsically disordered proteins. A deep understanding of the 
conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins in biomolecular 
condensates is therefore of utmost importance but is complicated by diverse 
obstacles. Here we review emerging data on the motions of intrinsically 
disordered proteins inside of liquidlike condensates. We discuss how 
liquid-liquid phase separation modulates internal motions across a wide range of 
time and length scales. We further highlight the importance of intermolecular 
interactions that not only drive liquid-liquid phase separation but appear as 
key determinants for changes in biomolecular motions and the aging of 
condensates in human diseases. The review provides a framework for future 
studies to reveal the conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered 
proteins in the regulation of biomolecular condensate chemistry.

The emerging applications of hydrogel materials at different length scales, in 
areas ranging from sustainability to health, have driven the progress in the 
design and manufacturing of microgels. Microgels can provide miniaturized, 
monodisperse, and regulatable compartments, which can be spatially separated or 
interconnected. These microscopic materials provide novel opportunities for 
generating biomimetic cell culture environments and are thus key to the advances 
of modern biomedical research. The evolution of the physical and chemical 
properties has, furthermore, highlighted the potentials of microgels in the 
context of materials science and bioengineering. This review describes the 
recent research progress in the fabrication, characterization, and applications 
of microgels generated from biomolecular building blocks. A key enabling 
technology allowing the tailoring of the properties of microgels is their 
synthesis through microfluidic technologies, and this paper highlights recent 
advances in these areas and their impact on expanding the physicochemical 
parameter space accessible using microgels. This review finally discusses the 
emerging roles that microgels play in liquid-liquid phase separation, 
micromechanics, biosensors, and regenerative medicine.

The mediation of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) for FUS protein is 
generally attributed to the low-complexity, disordered domains and is enhanced 
at low temperature. The role of FUS folded domains on the LLPS process remains 
relatively unknown since most studies are mainly based on fragmented FUS 
domains. Here, we investigate the effect of metabolites on full-length FUS LLPS 
using turbidity assays and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, 
and explore the behavior of the folded domains by nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) spectroscopy. Full-length FUS LLPS is maximal at low concentrations of 
glucose and glutamate, moderate concentrations of NaCl, Zn2+ and Ca2+ and at the 
isoelectric pH. The FUS RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and zinc-finger (ZnF) 
domains are found to undergo cold denaturation above 0°C at a temperature that 
is determined by the conformational stability of the ZnF domain. Cold unfolding 
exposes buried nonpolar residues that can participate in LLPS-promoting 
hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, these findings constitute the first 
evidence that FUS globular domains may have an active role in LLPS under cold 
stress conditions and in the assembly of stress granules, providing further 
insight into the environmental regulation of LLPS. This article is protected by

Diesel contamination poses a serious threat to ecosystem and human health. This 
study proposes a novel method for simultaneous diesel removal and recovery from 
heavily diesel-contaminated soil by washing based on three-liquid-phase 
equilibria of diesel+2-butoxyethanol+water. This work covers both 
theoretical-cum-experimental explorations. For this brand-new ternary 
three-liquid-phase system (TPS), Ternary-Gibbs and Fish-Shaped phase diagrams 
were constructed through the phase behavior investigation to provide theoretical 
support for diesel removal/recovery. As the experiment demonstrated, the removal 
efficiency was up to 87.5 % for the contaminated soil with diesel content of 
226,723 mg/kg, and the recovery rate reached 73.8 %. In addition, the TPS could 
also be used continuously during the washing process while avoiding solution 
purification, and the detached diesel would automatically float into the top 
phase without complicated separation. The mechanism of diesel removal was 
determined as the surface "stripping" effect based on ultralow interfacial 
tension, and the enhanced process involved "stripping+dissolution". The treated 
soil contained almost negligible organic solvent residue and was therefore 
appropriate for plant cultivation. The recovered diesel exhibited less variation 
from commercial diesel in composition and properties, possessing a higher 
potential for reuse. Moreover, this study also provided key insights into the 
residual mechanisms of recalcitrant hydrocarbons in the soil.

The bottom-up construction of an artificial cell requires the realization of 
synthetic cell division. Significant progress has been made toward reliable 
compartment division, yet mechanisms to segregate the DNA-encoded informational 
content are still in their infancy. Herein, droplets of DNA Y-motifs are formed 
by liquid-liquid phase separation. DNA droplet segregation is obtained by 
cleaving the linking component between two populations of DNA Y-motifs. In 
addition to enzymatic cleavage, photolabile sites are introduced for 
spatio-temporally controlled DNA segregation in bulk as well as in cell-sized 
water-in-oil droplets and giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). Notably, the 
segregation process is slower in confinement than in bulk. The ionic strength of 
the solution and the nucleobase sequences are employed to regulate the 
segregation dynamics. The experimental results are corroborated in a 
lattice-based theoretical model which mimics the interactions between the DNA 
Y-motif populations. Altogether, engineered DNA droplets, reconstituted in GUVs, 
can represent a strategy toward a DNA segregation module within bottom-up 
assembled synthetic cells.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins is known to 
underlie diverse pathologies such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and aging. The 
nucleation step of condensate formation is of critical importance for 
understanding how healthy and disease-associated condensates differ. Here, we 
describe four orthogonal single-molecule techniques that enable molecular 
tracking of the RNA-protein interaction, RNA-induced oligomerization, and 
kinetics of nucleation. These approaches allow researchers to directly 
interrogate the initial steps of liquid-liquid phase separation. For complete 
details on the use and execution of this profile, please refer to Niaki et al. 
(2020), Rhine et al. (2020), and Rhine et al. (2022).

In the present work, a new and efficient sorbent has been prepared using the 
co-precipitation method for magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction followed 
by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. This method was used for the 
extraction and preconcentration of some widely-used pesticides (chlorpyrifos, 
haloxyfop-R-methyl, oxadiazon, diniconazole, clodinafop-propargyl, 
fenpropathrin, and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl) from fruit juices prior to their 
determination by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. The sorbent was 
prepared by octadecylamine co-precipitation with Fe3O4. In the first step, mg 
amount of the magnetic sorbent was spread into an aqueous sample solution 
including the selected analytes and vortexed. Then the analytes were eluted with 
acetonitrile from the surface of the nanoparticles separated with an external 
magnetic field from the aqueous solution. In the second step, the obtained 
eluent was mixed with an extraction solvent (chloroform) at the μL-level and 
rapidly injected into deionized water. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the 
sedimented phase was injected into the separation system. Experimental 
parameters which control the performance of both steps were investigated and 
optimized. Using optimum extraction conditions, the proposed method provided low 
limits of detection (0.23-0.41 μg L-1) and quantification (0.81-1.3 μg L-1), 
high enrichment factors (353-443), acceptable extraction recoveries (70-88%), 
and satisfactory relative standard deviations (≤6%) for intra- (n = 6) and 
inter-day (n = 4) precisions at a concentration of 30 μg L-1 of each pesticide.

Pullulan is a microbial polymer, commercially produced from Aureobasidium 
pullulans. Downstream processing of pullulan involves a multi-stage process 
which should be efficient, safe and reproducible. In liquid-liquid separations, 
firstly cell free extract is separated. Cell biomass can be separated after 
fermentation either by centrifugation or filtration. Due to practically 
insolubility of pullulan in organic solvents, ethanol and isopropanol are the 
most commonly used organic solvents for its recovery. Pullulan can also be 
purified by chromatographic techniques, but these are not cost effective for the 
purification of pullulan. Efficient aqueous two-phase system can be used for the 
purification of pullulan. The current review describes the methods and 
perspectives used for solid-liquid separation, liquid-liquid separations and 
finishing steps for the recovery of pullulan. Techniques used to determine the 
structural attributes of pullulan have also been highlighted.

Membraneless biomolecular condensates (BMCs) contribute to the replication of a 
growing number of viruses but remain to be functionally characterized. 
Previously, we demonstrated that pan-retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) proteins phase 
separated into condensates regulating virus assembly. Here we discover that 
intrinsically disordered human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) core 
proteins condense with the viral genomic RNA (vRNA) to assemble as BMCs 
attaining a geometry characteristic of viral reverse transcription complexes. We 
explore the predisposition, mechanisms, and pharmacologic sensitivity of HIV-1 
core BMCs in living cells. HIV-1 vRNA-interacting NC condensates were found to 
be scaffolds onto which client capsid, reverse transcriptase, and integrase 
condensates assemble. HIV-1 core BMCs exhibit fundamental characteristics of 
BMCs and are drug-sensitive. Lastly, protease-mediated maturation of Gag and 
Gag-Pol precursor proteins yield abundant and visible BMCs in cells. This study 
redefines HIV-1 core components as fluid BMCs and advances our understanding of 
the nature of viral cores during ingress.

Resilin is an elastic material found in insects with exceptional durability, 
resilience, and extensibility, making it a promising biomaterial for tissue 
engineering. The monomeric precursor, pro-resilin, undergoes thermo-responsive 
self-assembly through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Understanding the 
molecular details of this assembly process is critical to developing complex 
biomaterials. The present study investigates the interplay between the solvent, 
sequence syntax, structure, and dynamics in promoting LLPS of 
resilin-like-polypeptides (RLPs) derived from domains 1 and 3 of Drosophila 
melanogaster pro-resilin. NMR, UV-vis, and microscopy data demonstrate that 
while kosmotropic salts and low pH promote LLPS, the effects of chaotropic salts 
with increasing pH are more complex. Subtle variations between the repeating 
amino acid motifs of resilin domain 1 and domain 3 lead to significantly 
different salt and pH dependence of LLPS, with domain 3 sequence motifs more 
strongly favoring phase separation under most conditions. These findings provide 
new insight into the molecular drivers of RLP phase separation and the complex 
roles of both RLP sequence and solution composition in fine-tuning assembly 
conditions.

It has been proposed that the intrinsic property of nucleosome arrays to undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro is responsible for chromatin 
domain organization in vivo. However, understanding nucleosomal LLPS has been 
hindered by the challenge to characterize the structure of the resulting 
heterogeneous condensates. We used cryo-electron tomography and 
deep-learning-based 3D reconstruction/segmentation to determine the molecular 
organization of condensates at various stages of LLPS. We show that nucleosomal 
LLPS involves a two-step process: a spinodal decomposition process yielding 
irregular condensates, followed by their unfavorable conversion into more 
compact, spherical nuclei that grow into larger spherical aggregates through 
accretion of spinodal materials or by fusion with other spherical condensates. 
Histone H1 catalyzes more than 10-fold the spinodal-to-spherical conversion. We 
propose that this transition involves exposure of nucleosome hydrophobic 
surfaces causing modified inter-nucleosome interactions. These results suggest a 
physical mechanism by which chromatin may transition from interphase to 
metaphase structures.

Wastewater analysis of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) biomarkers can provide 
essential information on trends in cannabis consumption. Although analysis is 
mostly focused on the aqueous phase, previous studies have illustrated the need 
of improving the measurements of raw influent wastewater (IWW) considering also 
suspended solids. This is important for cannabis biomarkers, because a 
substantial part of them is expected to be found in the suspended solids due to 
their more lipophilic character compared with other metabolites/drugs included 
in these types of studies. However, it remains open to which extent trend 
estimates might be affected by solely analysing the liquid phase. To investigate 
this aspect, robust analytical methodologies are required to measure both the 
liquid and solid phases of IWW. In this work, we firstly tested liquid-liquid 
extraction (LLE) for THC and its major metabolites (THCOH, and THCCOOH). Using 
LLE, no filtration or centrifugation step was required for raw IWW analysis, and 
the three analytes were extracted from both the liquid and the solid phase 
simultaneously. In parallel, the raw IWW was centrifuged and the obtained solid 
and liquid phases were analyzed separately: the liquid phase by both LLE and 
solid phase extraction (SPE) for comparison of data, and the suspended solids by 
solid-liquid extraction (SLE). The separate analysis of both phases in a number 
of samples revealed that a significant amount of cannabis biomarkers (ranging 
from 42 to 90%) was found in the suspended solids. In addition, the total amount 
of cannabis biomarkers obtained by analysing raw IWW on the one hand, and by 
separate analysis of the liquid and the solid phases, on the other hand, was in 
good agreement. Data from this study show that the sole analysis of the liquid 
phase would lead to a notable underestimation of cannabis biomarkers 
concentrations in IWW.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replicates its DNA genome in specialized 
replication compartments (RCs) in the host cell nucleus. These membrane-less 
organelles originate as spherical structures and grow in size over time. 
However, the mechanism of RC biogenesis has remained understudied. Using 
live-cell imaging and photo-oligomerization, we show that a central component of 
RCs, the UL112-113 proteins, undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to 
form RCs in the nucleus. We show that the self-interacting domain and large 
intrinsically disordered regions of UL112-113 are required for LLPS. 
Importantly, viral DNA induces local clustering of these proteins and lowers the 
threshold for phase separation. The formation of phase-separated compartments 
around viral genomes is necessary to recruit the viral DNA polymerase for viral 
genome replication. Thus, HCMV uses its UL112-113 proteins to generate RCs 
around viral genomes by LLPS to ensure the formation of a pro-replicative 
environment.

A derivatization and air-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 
procedure with organic phase solidification on a paper template was developed 
for the first time. The procedure was used for the spectrofluorometric 
determination of formaldehyde in milk samples. The Hantzsch reaction of 
formaldehyde with acetylacetone in the presence of ammonia to form a derivative 
(3,5-diacetyl-1,4-dihydrolutidine) was implemented for the microextraction and 
detection of analyte. Thymol was investigated as the extraction solvent for the 
air-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for the first time. In the 
developed procedure, molten thymol was added to the thermostated aqueous sample 
solution containing reagents for formaldehyde derivatization, and cloudy 
solution of fine thymol droplets was formed by air bubbling. After separation of 
phases the liquid extract phase was withdrawn with a dispenser and distributed 
on the black paper template in a thin layer to be solidified. The solidified 
extract phase on the template was inserted to a sample holder of a 
spectrofluorometer and fluorescence intensity was measured without using 
cuvettes. Under optimal experimental conditions the linear detection range was 
found to be 45-500 µg L-1 with LOD calculated from a blank test, based on 3σ, 
15 µg L-1. The developed procedure does not require the dilution of the solid 
extract phase in organic solvent to be introduced in an analytical 
instrumentation and the use of cuvettes for spectrofluorometric detection.

We have reported that ureido polymers exhibit upper critical solution 
temperature (UCST)-type phase behavior in solution, which is the opposite of 
lower critical solution temperature (LCST)-type behavior. Furthermore, UCST-type 
ureido polymers undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon cooling 
rather than the liquid-solid phase transition of the typical LCST-type polymers. 
In this study, ureido polymers with hydrophobic groups were prepared to evaluate 
the effects of cooling-induced LLPS of UCST-type polymers on refolding of 
proteins. When protein was heated with a ureido polymer functionalized with 
undecyl groups, aggregation of the protein was prevented. Subsequent cooling 
incubation resulted in the spontaneous release of the protein from the polymer. 
The released protein had enzymatic activity, suggesting that the protein 
refolded properly. Interestingly, efficient refolding was observed when the 
solution of the UCST-type ureido polymer and protein was incubated at around the 
phase separation temperature of the polymer, implying that cooling-induced LLPS 
of the polymer enhanced the release of the protein. Additionally, by 
centrifugation at 4 °C, the refolded protein was readily separated from the 
ureido polymers, which precipitated upon cooling.

Membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed through liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) are becoming increasingly relevant to understanding viral-host 
interactions, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer. The modulation of LLPS 
involves many parameters and components. To describe these modulators, typical 
in vitro studies require laborious, manual sample preparation of different 
concentrations and costly biological reagents. Here, we introduce a minimal 
reagent, microfluidic platform to systematically generate samples of different 
concentrations and trigger phase separation. We demonstrate the platform's 
utility by constructing phase diagrams describing the modulation of LLPS using 
an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) and an MLO-based phase separating system. We 
also show on-chip biophysical characterization typical of in vitro studies. We 
expect that this platform will be utilized by scientists to study the growing 
number of MLOs and inform clinical treatments for pathology related to LLPS.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), the spontaneous formation of contiguous 
liquid phases with distinct compositions, has been long known in chemical 
systems and more recently recognized as a ubiquitous feature of cell biology. We 
describe a system involving biologically relevant components, synthetic 
peptides, and total yeast RNA, that has enabled us to explore factors that 
underlie phase separation. Coulombic complementarity between a cationic peptide 
and anionic RNA is necessary but not sufficient for formation of a condensed 
phase in our system. In addition to a net positive charge, the peptide must 
present the proper type of cationic moiety. Guanidinium groups, as found in the 
Arg side chain, support phase separation, but ammonium groups, as found in the 
Lys side chain, or dimethylguanidinium groups, as found in post-translationally 
modified Arg side chains, do not support phase separation in our system. 
However, the cationic groups that do not support phase separation via 
interaction with RNA can nevertheless enable recruitment to a condensed phase, 
which reveals that the network of forces governing condensed phase formation can 
differ from the network of forces governing recruitment to such a phase. We 
introduce a new method for measuring the concentrations of components in 
condensed phases based on fluorine-containing additives and 19F NMR.

Many proteins harboring low complexity or intrinsically disordered sequences 
(IDRs) are capable of undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation to form 
mesoscale condensates that function as biochemical niches with the ability to 
concentrate or sequester macromolecules and regulate cellular activity. 
Engineered disordered proteins have been used to generate programmable synthetic 
membraneless organelles in cells. Phase separation is governed by the strength 
of interactions among polypeptides with multivalency enhancing phase separation 
at lower concentrations. Previously, we and others demonstrated enzymatic 
control of IDR valency from multivalent precursors to dissolve condensed phases. 
Here, we develop noncovalent strategies to multimerize an individual IDR, the 
RGG domain of LAF-1, using protein interaction domains to regulate condensate 
formation in vitro and in living cells. First, we characterize modular 
dimerization of RGG domains at either terminus using cognate high-affinity 
coiled-coil pairs to form stable condensates in vitro. Second, we demonstrate 
temporal control over phase separation of RGG domains fused to FRB and FKBP in 
the presence of dimerizer. Further, using a photocaged dimerizer, we achieve 
optically induced condensation both in cell-sized emulsions and within live 
cells. Collectively, these modular tools allow multiple strategies to promote 
phase separation of a common core IDR for tunable control of condensate

Our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of eukaryotic gene expression 
has recently been greatly stimulated by the findings that many of the regulators 
of chromatin, transcription, and RNA processing form biomolecular condensates 
often assembled through liquid-liquid phase separation. Increasing number of 
reports suggest that these condensates functionally regulate gene expression, 
largely by concentrating the relevant biomolecules in the liquid-like 
micro-compartments. However, it remains poorly understood how the 
physicochemical properties, especially the material properties, of the 
condensates regulate gene expression activity. In this review, we discuss 
current data on various nuclear condensates and their biophysical properties 
with the underlying molecular interactions, and how they may functionally impact 
gene expression at the level of chromatin organization and activities, 
transcription, and RNA processing.

Biomolecular condensates are membraneless, intracellular organelles that form 
via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and have the ability to concentrate a 
wide range of molecules in the cellular milieu. These organelles are highly 
dynamic and play pivotal roles in cellular organization and physiology. Many 
studies also link the formation and misregulation of condensates to diseases 
such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Biomolecular condensates 
represent a special type of colloids that actively interact with their 
environment to sustain physiological functions, due to which their misregulation 
may upset cell signaling, resulting in pathological states. In this review, we 
discuss the mechanisms underlying the formation, dynamics, and evolution of 
these biological colloids, with a special focus on their surface properties that 
are critical in their interaction with other components of the cell. We also 
summarize experimental approaches that enable the detailed characterization of 
the formation, interactions, and functions of these cellular colloidal 
organelles.

The misfolding and mutation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is commonly 
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). SOD1 can accumulate within 
stress granules (SGs), a type of membraneless organelle, which is believed to 
form via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Using wild-type, 
metal-deficient, and different ALS disease mutants of SOD1 and computer 
simulations, we report here that the absence of Zn leads to structural disorder 
within two loop regions of SOD1, triggering SOD1 LLPS and amyloid formation. The 
addition of exogenous Zn to either metal-free SOD1 or to the severe ALS mutation 
I113T leads to the stabilization of the loops and impairs SOD1 LLPS and 
aggregation. Moreover, partial Zn-mediated inhibition of LLPS was observed for 
another severe ALS mutant, G85R, which shows perturbed Zn-binding. By contrast, 
the ALS mutant G37R, which shows reduced Cu-binding, does not undergo LLPS. In 
addition, SOD1 condensates induced by Zn-depletion exhibit greater cellular 
toxicity than aggregates formed by prolonged incubation under aggregating 
conditions. Overall, our work establishes a role for Zn-dependent modulation of 
SOD1 conformation and LLPS properties that may contribute to amyloid formation.

Protein arginine methylation plays an important role in regulating protein 
functions in different cellular processes, and its dysregulation may lead to a 
variety of human diseases. Recently, arginine methylation was found to be 
involved in modulating protein liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which 
drives the formation of different membraneless organelles (MLOs). Here, we 
developed a steric effect-based chemical-enrichment method (SECEM) coupled with 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze arginine dimethylation 
(DMA) at the proteome level. We revealed by SECEM that, in mammalian cells, the 
DMA sites occurring in the RG/RGG motifs are preferentially enriched within the 
proteins identified in different MLOs, especially stress granules (SGs). 
Notably, global decrease of protein arginine methylation severely impairs the 
dynamic assembly and disassembly of SGs. By further profiling the dynamic change 
of DMA upon SG formation by SECEM, we identified that the most dramatic change 
of DMA occurs at multiple sites of RG/RGG-rich regions from several key 
SG-contained proteins, including G3BP1, FUS, hnRNPA1, and KHDRBS1. Moreover, 
both in vitro arginine methylation and mutation of the identified DMA sites 
significantly impair LLPS capability of the four different RG/RGG-rich regions. 
Overall, we provide a global profiling of the dynamic changes of protein DMA in 
the mammalian cells under different stress conditions by SECEM and reveal the 
important role of DMA in regulating protein LLPS and SG dynamics.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins preferentially involves intrinsically 
disordered proteins or disordered regions. Understanding the solution chemistry 
of these phase separations is key to learning how to quantify and manipulate 
systems that involve such processes. Here, we investigate the effect of 
cyclization on the liquid-liquid phase separation of short polyglycine peptides. 
We simulated separate aqueous systems of supersaturated cyclic and linear GGGGG 
and observed spontaneous liquid-liquid phase separation in each of the 
solutions. The cyclic GGGGG phase separates less robustly than linear GGGGG and 
has a higher aqueous solubility, even though linear GGGGG has a more favorable 
single molecule solvation free energy. The versatile and abundant interpeptide 
contacts formed by the linear GGGGG stabilize the condensed droplet phase, 
driving the phase separation in this system. In particular, we find that van der 
Waals close contact interactions are enriched in the droplet phase as opposed to 
electrostatic interactions. An analysis of the change in backbone conformational 
entropy that accompanies the phase transition revealed that cyclic peptides lose 
significantly less entropy in this process as expected. However, we find that 
the enhanced interaction enthalpy of linear GGGGG in the droplet phase is enough 
to compensate for a larger decrease in conformational entropy.

Tauopathies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases involve the abnormal 
deposition of tau aggregates in the brain and neuronal tissues. We report that a 
natural naphthoquinone, shikonin, impeded the oligomerization and fibrillization 
of tau. The compound strongly inhibited heparin, arachidonic acid, and 
RNA-induced tau aggregation. Atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering, 
SDS-PAGE, and dot blot assays revealed that shikonin diminished tau 
oligomerization and decreased the mean size of tau oligomers. Transmission 
electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analysis further showed that 
shikonin could suppress tau fibrillization and shorten the tau filaments. 
Shikonin inhibited tau droplet formation. The compound significantly reduced the 
aggregation rate of a tryptophan mutant (Y310W-tau) of tau. In addition, 
shikonin disaggregated preformed tau filaments with a half-maximal 
disaggregation concentration (DC50) of 6.3 ± 0.4 μM. Pre-treatment of 
neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) with shikonin protected the cells from the 
toxicity induced by tau oligomers and increased their viability. The findings 
imply that shikonin inhibited several steps in the tau aggregation pathways, 
especially the early stages, such as liquid-liquid phase separation. Therefore, 
shikonin is an attractive candidate for developing a therapy against tauopathy.

Pervaporation is one of the most active topics in membrane research, and it has 
time and again proven to be an essential component for chemical separation. It 
has been employed in the removal of impurities from raw materials, separation of 
products and by-products after reaction, and separation of pollutants from 
water. Given the global problem of water pollution, this approach is efficient 
in removing hazardous substances from water bodies. Conventional processes are 
based on thermodynamic equilibria involving a phase transition such as 
distillation and liquid-liquid extraction. These techniques have a relatively 
low efficacy and nowadays they are not recommended because it is not sustainable 
in terms of energy consumption and/or waste generation. Pervaporation emerged in 
the 1980s and is now becoming a popular membrane separation technology because 
of its intrinsic features such as low energy requirements, cheap separation 
costs, and good quality product output. The focus of this review is on current 
developments in pervaporation, mass transport in membranes, material selection, 
fabrication and characterization techniques, and applications of various 
membranes in the separation of chemicals from water.

High temperature is one of the abiotic stresses that plants face and acts as a 
major constraint on crop production and food security. Plants have evolved 
several mechanisms to overcome challenging environments and respond to internal 
and external stimuli. One significant mechanism is the formation of biomolecular 
condensates driven by liquid-liquid phase separation. Biomolecular condensates 
have received much attention in the past decade, especially with regard to how 
plants perceive temperature fluctuations and their involvement in stress 
response and tolerance. In this review, we compile and discuss examples of plant 
biomolecular condensates regarding their composition, localization, and 
functions triggered by exposure to heat. Bioinformatic tools can be exploited to 
predict heat-induced biomolecular condensates. As the field of biomolecular 
condensates has emerged in the study of plants, many intriguing questions have 
arisen that have yet to be solved. Increased knowledge of biomolecular 
condensates will help in securing crop production and overcoming limitations 
caused by heat stress.

Intracellular spaces are partitioned into separate compartments to ensure that 
numerous biochemical reactions and cellular functions take place in a 
spatiotemporally controlled manner. Biomacromolecules including proteins and 
RNAs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation and subsequent phase transition to 
form biological condensates with diverse material states. The material/physical 
properties of biological condensates are crucial for fulfilling their distinct 
physiological functions, and abnormal material properties can cause deleterious 
effects under pathological conditions. Here, we review recent studies showing 
the role of the material properties of biological condensates in their 
physiological functions. We also summarize several classic methods as well as 
newly emerging techniques for characterization and/or measurement of the 
material properties of biological condensates.

The nucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly and formed through liquid-liquid 
phase separation. Multiple ribosomal DNA (rDNA) arrays are bundled in the 
nucleolus, but the underlying mechanism and significance are unknown. In the 
present study, we performed high-content screening followed by image profiling 
with the wndchrm machine learning algorithm. We revealed that cells lacking a 
specific 60S ribosomal protein set exhibited common nucleolar disintegration. 
The depletion of RPL5 (also known as uL18), the liquid-liquid phase separation 
facilitator, was most effective, and resulted in an enlarged and un-separated 
sub-nucleolar compartment. Single-molecule tracking analysis revealed 
less-constrained mobility of its components. rDNA arrays were also unbundled. 
These results were recapitulated by a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model. 
Transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA were repressed in these aberrant 
nucleoli. Consistently, the nucleoli were disordered in peripheral blood cells 
from a Diamond-Blackfan anemia patient harboring a heterozygous, large deletion 
in RPL5 Our combinatorial analyses newly define the role of RPL5 in rDNA array 
bundling and the biophysical properties of the nucleolus, which may contribute 
to the etiology of ribosomopathy.

Protein aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein 
quality control (PQC) system normally prevents proteins from misfolding and 
accumulation; however, proteins somehow escape this control on disease. Here we 
review advances in the role of PQC in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. 
We focus primarily on the protein Tau, which aggregates in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and other tauopathies. We also examine recent advances in amyloid fibril 
structures and the process of fibril formation via phase separation, which are 
shedding new light on the role of PQC in protein aggregation diseases. While 
specific components of the quality control system appear to be altered in 
disease, most chaperones and degradation factors are unchanged at the cellular 
end stage. Advancing the understanding of quality control factors in 
neurodegeneration, particularly in the early stages of disease, is among the key 
challenges for neurodegeneration research.

In stark contrast to foldable proteins with a unique folded state, intrinsically 
disordered proteins and regions (IDPs) persist in perpetually disordered 
ensembles. Yet an IDP ensemble has conformational features-even when 
averaged-that are specific to its sequence. In fact, subtle changes in an IDP 
sequence can modulate its conformational features and its function. Recent 
advances in theoretical physics reveal a set of elegant mathematical expressions 
that describe the intricate relationships among IDP sequences, their ensemble 
conformations, and the regulation of their biological functions. These equations 
also describe the molecular properties of IDP sequences that predict 
similarities and dissimilarities in their functions and facilitate 
classification of sequences by function, an unmet challenge to traditional 
bioinformatics. These physical sequence-patterning metrics offer a promising new 
avenue for advancing synthetic biology at a time when multiple novel functional 
modes mediated by IDPs are emerging.

Catecholamines (CAs) and their metabolites play significant roles in many 
physiological processes. Changes in CAs concentration in vivo can serve as 
potential indicators for the diagnosis of several diseases such as 
pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Thus, the accurate quantification of CAs and 
their metabolites in biological samples is quite important and has attracted 
great research interest. However, due to their extremely low concentrations and 
numerous co-existing biological interferences, direct analysis of these 
endogenous compounds often suffers from severe difficulties. Employing suitable 
sample preparation techniques before instrument detection to enrich the target 
analytes and remove the interferences is a practicable and straightforward 
approach. To date, many sample preparation techniques such as solid-phase 
extraction (SPE), and liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) have been utilized to 
extract CAs and their metabolites from various biological samples. More 
recently, several modern techniques such as solid-phase microextraction (SPME), 
liquid-liquid microextraction (LLME), dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE), 
and chemical derivatizations have also been used with certain advanced features 
of automation and miniaturization. There are no review articles with the 
emphasis on sample preparations for the determination of catecholamine 
neurotransmitters in biological samples. Thus, this review aims to summarize 
recent progress and advances from 2015 to 2021, with emphasis on the sample 
preparation techniques combined with separation-based detection methods such 
capillary electrophoresis (CE) or liquid chromatography (LC) with various 
detectors. The current review manuscript would be helpful for the researchers 
with their research interests in diagnostic analysis and biological systems to 
choose suitable sample pretreatment and detection methods.

We previously reported that the polymers used in amorphous solid dispersion 
(ASD) formulations, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 
polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate (PVP-VA), and hypromellose (HPMC), distribute 
into the drug-rich phase of ibuprofen (IBP) formed by liquid-liquid phase 
separation, resulting in a reduction in the maximum drug supersaturation in the 
aqueous phase. Herein, the mechanism underlying the partitioning of the polymer 
into the drug-rich phase was investigated from a thermodynamic perspective. The 
dissolved IBP concentration in the aqueous phase and the amount of polymer 
distributed into the IBP-rich phase were quantitatively analyzed in 
IBP-supersaturated solutions containing different polymers using 
variable-temperature solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy. The polymer weight ratio in the IBP-rich phase increased at higher 
temperatures, leading to a more notable reduction of IBP amorphous solubility. 
Among the polymers, the amorphous solubility reduction was the greatest for the 
PVP-VA solution at lower temperatures, while HPMC reduced the amorphous 
solubility to the greatest extent at higher temperatures. The change in the 
order of polymer impact on the amorphous solubility resulted from the 
differences in the temperature dependency of polymer partitioning. The van't 
Hoff plot of the polymer partition coefficient revealed that both enthalpy and 
entropy changes for polymer transfer into the IBP-rich phase from the aqueous 
phase (ΔHaqueous→IBP-rich and ΔSaqueous→IBP-rich) gave positive values for most 
of the measured temperature range, indicating that polymer partitioning into the 
IBP-rich phase was an endothermic but entropically favorable process. The 
polymer transfer into the IBP-rich phase was more endothermic for HPMC than for 
PVP and PVP-VA. The solid-state NMR analysis of the IBP/polymer ASD implied that 
the newly formed IBP/polymer interactions in the IBP-rich phase upon polymer 
incorporation were weaker for HPMC, providing a rationale for the larger 
positive transfer enthalpy for HPMC. The change in Gibbs free energy for polymer 
transfer (ΔGaqueous→IBP-rich) showed negative values across the experimental 
temperature range, decreasing with an increase in temperature, indicating that 
the distribution of the polymer into the IBP-rich phase is favored at higher 
temperatures. Moreover, ΔGaqueous→IBP-rich for HPMC showed the greatest decrease 
with the temperature, likely reflecting the temperature-induced dehydration of 
HPMC in the aqueous phase. This study contributes fundamental insights into the 
phenomenon of polymer partitioning into drug-rich phases, furthering the 
understanding of achievable supersaturation levels and ultimately providing 
information on polymer selection for ASD formulations.

Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that has the ability to self-assemble 
to form paired helical and straight filaments in Alzheimer's disease, as well as 
the ability to form additional distinct tau filaments in other tauopathies. In 
the presence of microtubules, tau forms an elongated form associated with 
tubulin dimers via a series of imperfect repeats known as the microtubule 
binding repeats. Tau has recently been identified to have the ability to phase 
separate in vitro and in cells. The ability of tau to adopt a wide variety of 
conformations appears fundamental both to its biological function and also its 
association with neurodegenerative diseases. The recently highlighted 
involvement of low-complexity domains in liquid-liquid phase separation provides 
a critical link between the soluble function and the insoluble dysfunctional 
properties of tau.

α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is the major protein component of Lewy bodies, a key 
pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). The manganese ion Mn2+ has 
been identified as an environmental risk factor of PD. However, it remains 
unclear how Mn2+ regulates α-Syn aggregation. Here, we discovered that 
Mn2+accelerates α-Syn amyloid aggregation through the regulation of protein 
phase separation. We found that Mn2+ not only promotes α-Syn liquid-to-solid 
phase transition but also directly induces soluble α-Syn monomers to form 
solid-like condensates. Interestingly, the lipid membrane is integrated into 
condensates during Mn2+-induced α-Syn phase transition; however, the preformed 
Mn2+/α-syn condensates can only recruit lipids to the surface of condensates. In 
addition, this phase transition can largely facilitate α-Syn amyloid 
aggregation. Although the Mn2+-induced condensates do not fuse, our results 
demonstrated that they could recruit soluble α-Syn monomers into the existing 
condensates. Furthermore, we observed that a manganese chelator reverses 
Mn2+-induced α-Syn aggregation during the phase transition stage. However, after 
maturation, α-Syn aggregation becomes irreversible. These findings demonstrate 
that Mn2+ facilitates α-Syn phase transition to accelerate the formation of 
α-Syn aggregates and provide new insights for targeting α-Syn phase separation 
in PD treatment.

TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a DNA/RNA binding protein involved in 
pivotal cellular functions, especially in RNA metabolism. Hyperphosphorylated 
and ubiquitinated TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions are identified 
in the brain and spinal cord in most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS) and a substantial proportion of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) 
cases. TDP-43 dysfunctions and cytoplasmic aggregation seem to be the central 
pathogenicity in ALS and FTLD. Therefore, unraveling both the physiological and 
pathological mechanisms of TDP-43 may enable the exploration of novel 
therapeutic strategies. This review highlights the current understanding of 
TDP-43 biology and pathology, describing the cellular processes involved in the 
pathogeneses of ALS and FTLD, such as post-translational modifications, RNA 
metabolism, liquid-liquid phase separation, proteolysis, and the potential 
prion-like propagation propensity of the TDP-43 inclusions.

Field-theory simulation by the complex Langevin method offers an alternative to 
conventional sampling techniques for exploring the forces driving biomolecular 
liquid-liquid phase separation. Such simulations have recently been used to 
study several polyampholyte systems. Here, we formulate a field theory 
corresponding to the hydrophobic/polar (HP) lattice protein model, with finite 
same-site repulsion and nearest-neighbor attraction between HH bead pairs. By 
direct comparison with particle-based Monte Carlo simulations, we show that 
complex Langevin sampling of the field theory reproduces the thermodynamic 
properties of the HP model only if the same-site repulsion is not too strong. 
Unfortunately, the repulsion has to be taken weaker than what is needed to 
prevent condensed droplets from assuming an artificially compact shape. Analysis 
of a minimal and analytically solvable toy model hints that the sampling 
problems caused by repulsive interaction may stem from loss of ergodicity.

Biochemical processes often require spatial regulation and specific 
microenvironments. The general lack of organelles in bacteria limits the 
potential of bioengineering complex intracellular reactions. Here, we 
demonstrate synthetic membraneless organelles in Escherichia coli termed 
transcriptionally engineered addressable RNA solvent droplets (TEARS). TEARS are 
assembled from RNA-binding protein recruiting domains fused to poly-CAG repeats 
that spontaneously drive liquid-liquid phase separation from the bulk cytoplasm. 
Targeting TEARS with fluorescent proteins revealed multilayered structures with 
composition and reaction robustness governed by non-equilibrium dynamics. We 
show that TEARS provide organelle-like bioprocess isolation for sequestering 
biochemical pathways, controlling metabolic branch points, buffering mRNA 
translation rates, and scaffolding protein-protein interactions. We anticipate 
TEARS to be a simple and versatile tool for spatially controlling E. coli 
biochemistry. Particularly, the modular design of TEARS enables applications 
without expression fine-tuning, simplifying the design-build-test cycle of 
bioengineering.

Condensate formation by a group of metabolic enzymes in the cell is an efficient 
way of regulating cell metabolism through the formation of "membrane-less 
organelles." Because of the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) for 
investigating protein localization, various enzymes were found to form 
condensates or filaments in living Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammalian cells, 
and in other organisms, thereby regulating cell metabolism in the certain status 
of the cells. Among different environmental stresses, hypoxia triggers the 
spatial reorganization of many proteins, including more than 20 metabolic 
enzymes, to form numerous condensates, including "Glycolytic body (G-body)" and 
"Purinosome." These individual condensates are collectively named "Metabolic 
Enzymes Transiently Assembling (META) body". This review overviews condensate or 
filament formation by metabolic enzymes in S. cerevisiae, focusing on the META 
body, and recent reports in elucidating regulatory machinery of META body 
formation.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives membraneless organelles (MLOs) 
formation for organizing biomolecules. Artificial MLOs (AMLOs) have been 
constructed mostly via the LLPS of engineered proteins capable of regulating 
limited types of biomolecules. Here, leveraging a minimalist AMLO, driven by 
LLPS of polymer-oligopeptide hybrids, enrichment, recruitment, and release of 
multifaceted cargoes are quantitatively shown, including small fluorescent 
molecules, fluorophore-containing macromolecules, proteins, DNAs, and RNAs. 
Cargoes show up to 105 -fold enrichment, whilst recruitment and release are 
triggered by variations of temperature, pH, and/or ionic strength. Also, the 
first efficacious, rapid, and reversible control of aggregation-induced emission 
with over 30 folds of modulation of overall fluorescence intensity is achieved, 
by intensifying the aggregation of luminogens in AMLO. The AMLO is a simple yet 
versatile platform for potential drug delivery and biosensor applications.

Insoluble protein deposits are hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders and 
common forms of dementia. The aberrant aggregation of misfolded proteins 
involves a complex cascade of events that occur over time, from the cellular to 
the clinical phase of neurodegeneration. Declining neuronal health through 
increased cell stress and loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) functions 
correlate with the accumulation of aggregates. On the cellular level, increasing 
evidence supports that misfolded proteins may undergo liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS), which is emerging as an important process to drive protein 
aggregation. Studying the reverse process of aggregate disassembly and 
degradation has only recently gained momentum, following reports of enzymes with 
distinct aggregate-disassembly activities. In this review, we will discuss how 
the ubiquitin-proteasome system and disaggregation machineries such as VCP/p97 
and HSP70 system may disassemble and/or degrade protein aggregates. In addition 
to their canonically associated functions, these enzymes appear to share a 
common feature: reversibly assembling into liquid droplets in an LLPS-driven 
manner. We review the role of LLPS in enhancing the disassembly of aggregates 
through locally increasing the concentration of these enzymes and their 
co-proteins together within droplet structures. We propose that such activity 
may be achieved through the concerted actions of disaggregase machineries, the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system and their co-proteins, all of which are condensed 
within transient aggregate-associated droplets (TAADs), ultimately resulting in 
aggregate clearance. We further speculate that sustained engagement of these 
enzymatic activities within TAADs will be detrimental to normal cellular 
functions, where these activities are required. The possibility of facilitating 
endogenous disaggregation and degradation activities within TAADs potentially 
represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention to restore protein 
homeostasis at the early stages of neurodegeneration.

A Census of Human Methionine-Rich Prion-like Domain-Containing Proteins.

Malaga, Spain.

Methionine-rich prion-like proteins can regulate liquid-liquid phase separation 
processes in response to stresses. To date, however, very few proteins have been 
identified as methionine-rich prion-like. Herein, we have performed a 
computational survey of the human proteome to search for methionine-rich 
prion-like domains. We present a census of 51 manually curated methionine-rich 
prion-like proteins. Our results show that these proteins tend to be modular in 
nature, with molecular sizes significantly greater than those we would expect 
due to random sampling effects. These proteins also exhibit a remarkably high 
degree of spatial compaction when compared to average human proteins, even when 
protein size is accounted for. Computational evidence suggests that such a high 
degree of compactness might be due to the aggregation of methionine residues, 
pointing to a potential redox regulation of compactness. Gene ontology and 
network analyses, performed to shed light on the biological processes in which 
these proteins might participate, indicate that methionine-rich and 
non-methionine-rich prion-like proteins share gene ontology terms related to the 
regulation of transcription and translation but, more interestingly, these 
analyses also reveal that proteins from the methionine-rich group tend to share 
more gene ontology terms among them than they do with their non-methionine-rich 
prion-like counterparts.

Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates containing 
proteins and RNAs in response to stress. Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding 
protein 1 (G3BP1) is a core SG protein. Caprin-1 and ubiquitin specific 
peptidase 10 (USP10) interact with G3BP1, facilitating and suppressing SG 
formation, respectively. The crystal structures of the nuclear transport factor 
2-like (NTF2L) domain of G3BP1 in complex with the G3BP1-interacting motif (GIM) 
of Caprin-1 and USP10 show that both GIMs bind to the same hydrophobic pocket of 
G3BP1. Moreover, both GIMs suppressed the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
of G3BP1, suggesting that Caprin-1 likely facilitates SG formation via other 
mechanisms. Thus, we dissected various domains of Caprin-1 and investigated 
their role in LLPS in vitro and SG formation in cells. The C-terminal domain of 
Caprin-1 underwent spontaneous LLPS, whereas the N-terminal domain and GIM of 
Caprin-1 suppressed LLPS of G3BP1. The opposing effect of the N- and C-terminal 
domains of Caprin-1 on SG formation were demonstrated in cells with or without 
the endogenous Caprin-1. We propose that the N- and C-terminal domains of 
Caprin-1 regulate SG formation in a "yin and yang" fashion, mediating the 
dynamic and reversible assembly of SGs.

BACKGROUND: Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) belongs to a class of nonheme 
iron-containing dioxygenases involved in the catalysis of leukotriene 
biosynthesis. However, the effects of Alox5 itself on pathological cardiac 
remodeling and heart failure remain elusive.
METHODS: The role of Alox5 in pathological cardiac remodeling was investigated 
by Alox5 genetic depletion, AAV9-mediated overexpression in cardiomyocytes, and 
a bone marrow (BM) transplantation approach. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were 
used to explore the effects of Alox5 in vitro. Molecular and signaling pathways 
were revealed by CUT &Tag, IP-MS, RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses.
FINDINGS: Untargeted metabolomics showed that serum 5-HETE (a primary product of 
Alox5) levels were little changed in patients with cardiac hypertrophy, while 
Alox5 expression was significantly upregulated in murine hypertensive cardiac 
samples and human cardiac samples of hypertrophy, which prompted us to test 
whether high Alox5 levels under hypertensive stimuli were directly associated 
with pathologic myocardium in an enzymatic activity-independent manner. Herein, 
we revealed that Alox5 deficiency significantly ameliorated transverse aortic 
constriction (TAC)-induced hypertrophy. Cardiomyocyte-specific Alox5 depletion 
attenuated hypertensive ventricular remodeling. Conversely, cardiac-specifical 
Alox5 overexpression showed a pro-hypertrophic cardiac phenotype. Ablation of 
Alox5 in bone marrow-derived cells did not affect pathological cardiac 
remodeling and heart failure. Mechanically, Runx2 was identified as a target of 
Alox5. In this regard, Alox5 PEST domain could directly bind to Runx2 PTS 
domain, promoting nuclear localization of Runx2 in an enzymatic 
activity-independent manner, simultaneously contributed to liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) of Runx2 at specific domain in the nucleus and increased 
transcription of EGFR in cardiomyocytes. Runx2 depletion alleviated hypertrophy 
in Ang II-pretreated Alox5-overexpressing cardiomyocytes.
INTERPRETATION: Overall, our study demonstrated that targeting Alox5 exerted a 
protective effect against cardiac remodeling and heart failure under 
hypertensive stimuli by disturbing LLPS of Runx2 and substantial reduction of 
EGFR transcription activation in cardiomyocytes. Our findings suggest that 
negative modulation of Alox5-Runx2 may provide a therapeutic approach against 
pathological cardiac remodeling and heart failure.

Exciting recent work has highlighted that numerous cellular compartments lack 
encapsulating lipid bilayers (often called "membraneless organelles"), and that 
their structure and function are central to the regulation of key biological 
processes, including transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and more. These 
structures have been described as "biomolecular condensates" to underscore that 
biomolecules can be significantly concentrated in them. Many condensates, 
including RNA granules and processing bodies, are enriched in proteins and 
nucleic acids. Biomolecular condensates exhibit a range of material states from 
liquid- to gel-like, with the physical process of liquid-liquid phase separation 
implicated in driving or contributing to their formation. To date, in vitro 
studies of phase separation have provided mechanistic insights into the 
formation and function of condensates. However, the link between the often 
micron-sized in vitro condensates with nanometer-sized cellular correlates has 
not been well established. Consequently, questions have arisen as to whether 
cellular structures below the optical resolution limit can be considered 
biomolecular condensates. Similarly, the distinction between condensates and 
discrete dynamic hub complexes is debated. Here we discuss the key features that 
define biomolecular condensates to help understand behaviors of structures 
containing and generating RNA.

The ability of stem cells to divide asymmetrically is crucial for cell-type 
diversity and tissue homeostasis. Drosophila neural stem cells, also knowns as 
neuroblasts, utilize asymmetric cell division to self-renew and give rise to 
differentiated daughter cells. Drosophila neuroblasts relies on the polarized 
protein complexes on the apical and basal cortex to govern cell polarity and 
asymmetry. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the 
neuroblast polarity focusing on how actin cytoskeleton, phosphoinositide lipids 
and liquid-liquid phase separation regulate the asymmetric cell division of 
Drosophila neuroblasts.

Membraneless organelles (MLOs) present as a condensed metastable phase of 
different proteins and RNAs organized via liquid-liquid phase separation. Recent 
evidence suggests the extensive incorporation of molecular chaperones into the 
dynamic assembly of MLOs, where different chaperones coordinate to 
spatiotemporally maintain the protein homeostasis and avoid abnormal protein 
aggregation.

Proper function of the body is maintained by an intricate interaction and 
communication among cells. during the animal development how these cells are 
formed and maintained is an important yet elusive. Understanding of how cells 
such as muscle and nerve cells maintain their identities would enable us to 
control the diseases which include malfunctioning in cellular identities such as 
cancer. In this article, we describe how the concept of formation and 
maintenance of cell identities has changed over the last 100 years. We will also 
briefly describe our current experimental work which includes transcriptional 
dynamics, and protein-protein interaction and how they are bringing new 
molecular insights. We also describe liquid-liquid phase separation as a 
potential new mechanism for the stability of gene expression in the non dvididng 
specialised cells of Xenopus oocytes.

Coacervate microdroplets, formed via liquid-liquid phase separation, have been 
proposed as a compartment model for the construction of artificial cells or 
organelles. However, these microsystems are very fragile and demonstrate 
liquid-like fluidity. Here, an artificial cytoskeleton based on DNA nanotubes 
was constructed in coacervate microdroplets to modulate the liquid fluidic 
properties of the microdroplets. The coacervate microdroplets were obtained from 
the association of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes through liquid-liquid 
phase separation, and DNA nanotubes were constructed by molecular tile 
self-assembly from six clip sequences. The DNA nanotubes were efficiently 
sequestered in the liquid coacervate microdroplets, and the rigid structure of 
the DNA nanotubes was capable of modulating the liquid fluidic properties of the 
coacervate protocell models, as indicated by coalescence imaging and atomic 
force microscopy analysis. Therefore, artificial cytoskeletons made from DNA 
nanotubes worked in modulating the liquid fluidic properties of coacervate 
microdroplets, in a manner akin to the cytoskeleton in the cell. DNA 
cytoskeletons have the potential to become an ideal platform with which how the 
liquid fluidic properties of cells are modulated by their cytoskeletons can be 
investigated, and the cell-sized coacervate microdroplets containing artificial 
cytoskeletons might be critical in developing a stable liquid-phase protocell 
model.

Stress granules are non-membrane bound RNA-protein granules essential for 
survival during acute cellular stress. TIA-1 is a key protein in the formation 
of stress granules that undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation by association 
with specific RNAs and protein-protein interactions. However, the fundamental 
properties of the TIA-1 protein that enable phase-separation also render TIA-1 
susceptible to the formation of irreversible fibrillar aggregates. Despite this, 
within physiological stress granules, TIA-1 is not present as fibrils, pointing 
to additional factors within the cell that prevent TIA-1 aggregation. Here we 
show that heterotypic interactions with stress granule co-factors Zn2+ and 
RGG-rich regions from FUS each act together with nucleic acid to induce the 
liquid-liquid phase separation of TIA-1. In contrast, these co-factors do not 
enhance nucleic acid induced fibril formation of TIA-1, but rather robustly 
inhibit the process. NMR titration experiments revealed specific interactions 
between Zn2+ and H94 and H96 in RRM2 of TIA-1. Strikingly, this interaction 
promotes multimerization of TIA-1 independently of the prion-like domain. Thus, 
through different molecular mechanisms, these stress granule co-factors promote 
TIA-1 liquid-liquid phase separation and suppress fibrillar aggregates, 
potentially contributing to the dynamic nature of stress granules and the 
cellular protection that they provide.

Membraneless organelles have emerged during the evolution of eukaryotic cells as 
intracellular domains in which multiple proteins organize into complex 
structures to perform specialized functions without the need of a lipid bilayer 
compartment. Here we describe the perinuclear space of eukaryotic cells as a 
highly organized network of cytoskeletal filaments that facilitates assembly of 
biomolecular condensates. Using bioinformatic analyses, we show that the 
perinuclear proteome is enriched in intrinsic disorder with several proteins 
predicted to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. We also analyze 
immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy images showing the 
association between the nucleus and other organelles, such as mitochondria and 
lysosomes, or the labeling of specific proteins within the perinuclear region of 
cells. Altogether our data support the existence of a perinuclear dense 
sub-micron region formed by a well-organized three-dimensional network of 
structural and signaling proteins, including several proteins containing 
intrinsically disordered regions with phase behavior. This network of 
filamentous cytoskeletal proteins extends a few micrometers from the nucleus, 
contributes to local crowding, and organizes the movement of molecular complexes 
within the perinuclear space. Our findings take a key step towards understanding 
how membraneless regions within eukaryotic cells can serve as hubs for 
biomolecular condensates assembly, in particular the perinuclear space. Finally, 
evaluation of the disease context of the perinuclear proteins revealed that 
alterations in their expression can lead to several pathological conditions, and 
neurological disorders and cancer are among the most frequent.

Programmable coacervates based on zwitterionic polymers are designed as dynamic 
materials for ion exchange bioseparation. These coacervates are proposed as 
promising materials for the purification of soft nanoparticles such as liposomes 
and extracellular vesicles (EVs). It is shown that the stimulus-responsiveness 
of the coacervates and the recruitment of desired molecules can be independently 
programmed by polymer design. Moreover, the polymeric coacervates can recruit 
and release intact liposomes, human EVs, and nanoalgosomes in high yields and 
separate vesicles from different types of impurities, including proteins and 
nucleic acids. This approach combines the speed and simplicity of precipitation 
methods and the programmability of chromatography with the gentleness of aqueous 
two-phase separation, thereby guaranteeing product stability. This material 
represents a promising alternative for providing a low-shear, gentle, and 
selective purification method for EVs.

By forming specific functional entities, nuclear biomolecular condensates play 
an important function in guiding biological processes. PML biomolecular 
condensates, also known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs), are macro-molecular 
sub-nuclear organelles involved in central biological processes, including 
anti-viral response and cell fate control upon genotoxic stress. PML condensate 
formation is stimulated upon cellular stress, and relies on protein-protein 
interactions establishing a PML protein meshwork capable of recruiting the tumor 
suppressor p53, along with numerous modifiers of p53, thus balancing p53 
posttranslational modifications and activity. This stress-regulated process 
appears to be controlled by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which may 
facilitate regulated protein-unmixing of p53 and its regulators into PML nuclear 
condensates. In this review, we summarize and discuss the molecular mechanisms 
underlying PML nuclear condensate formation, and how these impact the biological 
function of p53 in driving the cell death and senescence responses. In addition, 
by using an in silico approach, we identify 299 proteins which share PML and p53 
as binding partners, thus representing novel candidate proteins controlling p53 
function and cell fate decision-making at the level of PML nuclear 
biocondensates.

Colorimetric determination with dithizone (diphenylthiocarbazone) is a simple 
method that has been applied to analyze cadmium (Cd) ions in water. However, 
determining concentrations close to the environmental standard value (3 μgL-1) 
using this method is difficult because of its low sensitivity. Herein, we 
exploited the phase separation phenomenon to generate a small amount of the 
extraction phase by adding a mixture of 2-propanol and a small amount of 
chloroform to a water sample, as a pre-concentration method for the Cd(II) ions. 
The obtained Cd(II)-dithizone complex was successfully extracted into this 
phase. We then constructed a simple and highly sensitive colorimetric analysis 
method for the ppb level of Cd(II) using this phase separation technique.

Engineering synthetic cells has a broad appeal, from understanding living cells 
to designing novel biomaterials for therapeutics, biosensing, and hybrid 
interfaces. A key prerequisite to creating synthetic cells is a 
three-dimensional container capable of orchestrating biochemical reactions. In 
this study, we present an easy and effective technique to make cell-sized porous 
containers, coined actinosomes, using the interactions between biomolecular 
condensates and the actin cytoskeleton. This approach uses 
polypeptide/nucleoside triphosphate condensates and localizes actin monomers on 
their surface. By triggering actin polymerization and using osmotic gradients, 
the condensates are transformed into containers, with the boundary made up of 
actin filaments and polylysine polymers. We show that the guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP)-to-adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio is a crucial parameter for forming 
actinosomes: insufficient ATP prevents condensate dissolution, while excess ATP 
leads to undesired crumpling. Permeability studies reveal the porous surface of 
actinosomes, allowing small molecules to pass through while restricting bigger 
macromolecules within the interior. We show the functionality of actinosomes as 
bioreactors by carrying out in vitro protein translation within them. 
Actinosomes are a handy addition to the synthetic cell platform, with appealing 
properties like ease of production, inherent encapsulation capacity, and a 
potentially active surface to trigger signaling cascades and form multicellular 
assemblies, conceivably useful for biotechnological applications.

In cells, segregation allows for diverse biochemical reactions to take place 
simultaneously. Such intricate regulation of cellular processes is achieved 
through the dynamic formation and disassembly of membraneless organelles via 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Herein, we demonstrate the 
light-controlled formation and disassembly of liquid droplets formed from a 
complex of polylysine (pLys) and arylazopyrazole (AAP)-conjugated 
single-stranded DNA. Photoswitchablility of droplet formation was also shown to 
be applicable to the control of chemical reactions; imine formation and a 
DNAzyme-catalyzed oxidation reaction were accelerated in the presence of 
droplets. These outcomes were reversed upon droplet disassembly. Our results 
demonstrate that the photoswitchable droplet formation system is a versatile 
model for the regulation of reactions through dynamic LLPS.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a common biophysical event 
that facilitates the formation of non-membrane-bound cellular compartments, also 
termed biomolecular condensates. Since the first report of a biomolecular 
condensate in the germline of C. elegans, many regulatory hubs have been shown 
to have similar liquid-like features. With the wealth of molecules now being 
reported to possess liquid-like features, an impetus has been placed on 
reconciling LLPS with regulation of specific biological properties in vivo. 
Herein, we report a methodology used to study LLPS-associated features in C. 
elegans neurons, illustrated using the RNA granule protein TIAR-2. In axons, 
TIAR-2 forms liquid-like granules, which following injury are inhibitory to the 
regeneration process. Measuring the dynamics of TIAR-2 granules provides a 
tractable biological output to study LLPS function. In conjunction with other 
established methods to assess LLPS, the results from the protocol outlined 
provide comprehensive insight regarding this important biophysical property.

Chromatin organization is important for many DNA-templated processes in 
eukaryotic cells such as replication and transcription. Recent studies have 
uncovered the capacity of epigenetic modifications, phase separation, and 
nuclear architecture and spatial positioning to regulate chromatin organization 
in both plants and animals. Here, we provide an overview of the recent progress 
made in understanding how chromatin is organized within the nucleus at both the 
local and global levels with respect to the regulation of transcriptional 
silencing in plants. To be concise while covering important mechanisms across a 
range of scales, we focus on how epigenetic modifications and chromatin 
remodelers alter local chromatin structure, how liquid-liquid phase separation 
physically separates broader chromatin domains into distinct droplets, and how 
nuclear positioning affects global chromatin organization.

Eukaryotic gene expression is regulated through chromatin conformation, in which 
enhancers and promoters physically interact (E-P interactions). How such 
chromatin-mediated E-P interactions affect gene expression is not yet fully 
understood, but the roles of histone acetylation and methylation, pioneer 
transcription factors, and architectural proteins such as CCCTC binding factor 
(CTCF) and cohesin have recently attracted attention. Moreover, accumulated data 
suggest that E-P interactions are mechanistically involved in biophysical 
events, including liquid-liquid phase separation, and in biological events, 
including cancers. In this review, we discuss various mechanisms that regulate 
eukaryotic gene expression, focusing on emerging views regarding chromatin 
conformations that are involved in E-P interactions and factors that establish 
and maintain them.

Phase-separated biomolecular condensates that contain multiple coexisting phases 
are widespread in vitro and in cells. Multiphase condensates emerge readily 
within multicomponent mixtures of biomolecules (e.g., proteins and nucleic 
acids) when the different components present sufficient physicochemical 
diversity (e.g., in intermolecular forces, structure, and chemical composition) 
to sustain separate coexisting phases. Because such diversity is highly coupled 
to the solution conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, salt, composition), it can 
manifest itself immediately from the nucleation and growth stages of condensate 
formation, develop spontaneously due to external stimuli or emerge progressively 
as the condensates age. Here, we investigate thermodynamic factors that can 
explain the progressive intrinsic transformation of single-component condensates 
into multiphase architectures during the nonequilibrium process of aging. We 
develop a multiscale model that integrates atomistic simulations of proteins, 
sequence-dependent coarse-grained simulations of condensates, and a minimal 
model of dynamically aging condensates with nonconservative intermolecular 
forces. Our nonequilibrium simulations of condensate aging predict that 
single-component condensates that are initially homogeneous and liquid like can 
transform into gel-core/liquid-shell or liquid-core/gel-shell multiphase 
condensates as they age due to gradual and irreversible enhancement of 
interprotein interactions. The type of multiphase architecture is determined by 
the aging mechanism, the molecular organization of the gel and liquid phases, 
and the chemical makeup of the protein. Notably, we predict that interprotein 
disorder to order transitions within the prion-like domains of intracellular 
proteins can lead to the required nonconservative enhancement of intermolecular 
interactions. Our study, therefore, predicts a potential mechanism by which the 
nonequilibrium process of aging results in single-component multiphase 
condensates.

A sensitive and selective UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the synchronized 
determination of four drugs used in severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), namely, azithromycin, apixaban, dexamethasone, and 
favipiravir in rat plasma. using a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 
2.7 m) with a high-resolution ESI tandem mass spectrometer detection with 
multiple reaction monitoring. We used an Agilent Poroshell column, which is 
characterized by a stationary phase based on non-porous core particles. With a 
remarkable improvement in the number of theoretical plates and low column 
backpressure. In addition, the developed method was employed in studying the 
potential food-drug interaction of grapefruit juice (GFJ) with the selected 
drugs which affects their pharmacokinetics in rats. The LC-MS/MS operated in 
positive and negative ionization mode using two internal standards: moxifloxacin 
and chlorthalidone, respectively. Liquid- liquid extraction of the cited drugs 
from rat plasma was accomplished using diethyl ether: dichloromethane (70:30, 
v/v). The analytes were separated using methanol: 0.1 % formic acid in water 
(95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase in isocratic mode of elution pumped at a flow 
rate of 0.3 mL/min. A detailed validation of the bio-analytical method was 
performed in accordance with US-FDA and EMA guidelines. Concerning the in vivo 
pharmacokinetic study, the statistical significance between the results of the 
test groups receiving GFJ along with the cited drugs and the control group was 
assessed demonstrating that GFJ increased the plasma concentration of 
azithromycin, apixaban, and dexamethasone. Accordingly, this food-drug 
interaction requires cautious ingestion of GFJ in patients using (SARS-CoV-2) 
medications as it can produce negative effects in the safety of the drug 
therapy. A potential drug-drug interaction is also suggested between those 
medications requiring a suitable dose adjustment.

All-aqueous microdroplets produced by liquid-liquid phase separation have 
emerged as promising models of artificial cells, and offer new approaches for 
the solvent-free encapsulation of fragile solutes. Yet, the lack of a membrane 
on such droplets makes them intrinsically unstable against coarsening, and 
precludes a fine control over chemical localization, as solutes can freely 
diffuse through the interface. Herein, we report the construction of stable and 
impermeable water-in-water emulsions via the interfacial self-assembly of mixed 
sodium oleate/1-decanol bilayers on dextran-rich droplets produced by 
segregative liquid-liquid phase separation with poly(ethylene glycol). Lipids 
spontaneously self-assemble as multilamellar structures at the surface of the 
droplets as revealed by freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy and 
small-angle X-ray scattering. We further demonstrate that the lipid-based 
membrane is impermeable to oligonucleotides and proteins, but also to a low 
molecular weight dye, so that a strict chemical encapsulation can be achieved by 
spontaneous partitioning within the droplets before membrane self-assembly. 
Taken together, our results highlight the ease of production of fatty 
acid-stabilized all-aqueous emulsions droplets able to encapsulate a range of 
solutes without the need of oil or organic solvents, paving the way to the 
construction of robust membrane-bounded, polymer-rich artificial cells.

Very little is known about how the material properties of protein condensates 
assembled via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) are maintained and affect 
physiological functions. Here we show that liquid-like condensates of the 
transcription factor TFEB exhibit low fusion propensity in vitro and in living 
cells. We directly measured the attraction force between droplets, and we 
characterized the interfacial tension, viscosity, and elasticity of TFEB 
condensates. TFEB condensates contain rigid interfacial boundaries that govern 
their interaction behaviors. Several small molecules, including Ro-3306, modify 
the material properties of TFEB condensates, increasing their size and fusion 
propensity. These compounds promote lysosomal biogenesis and function in a 
TFEB-dependent manner without changing its cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. 
Ro-3306 promotes autophagy activity, facilitating degradation of toxic protein 
aggregates. Our study helps explain how protein condensates are maintained as 
physically separate entities and reveals that the material properties of TFEB 
condensates can be harnessed to modulate TFEB activity.

Dipeptide repeat proteins (DRPs) are considered a significant cause of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and their liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) formation with other biological molecules has been studied both in vitro 
and in vivo. The immobilization and wetting of the LLPS droplets on glass 
surfaces are technically crucial for the measurement with optical microscopy. In 
this work, we characterized the surface diffusion of LLPS droplets of the DRPs 
with different lengths to investigate the multivalent effect on the interactions 
of their LLPS droplets with the glass surface. Using fluorescence microscopy and 
the single-particle tracking method, we observed that the large multivalency 
drastically changed the surface behavior of the droplets. The coalescence and 
wetting of the droplets were accelerated by increasing the multivalency of 
peptides in the LLPS system. Our findings on the effect of multivalency on 
interactions between droplets and glass surfaces could provide a new insight to 
enhance the understanding of LLPS formation and biophysical properties related 
to the solid/liquid interface.

Traditional methods of molecular confinement have physicochemical barriers that 
restrict the free passage of substrates/products. Here, we explored 
liquid-liquid phase separation as a method to restrain protein-metal 
nanocomposites within barrier-free condensates. Confinement within liquid 
droplets was independent of the protein's native conformation and amplified the 
catalytic efficiency of metal nanocatalysts by one order of magnitude.

Androgen receptor signaling and spatial chromatin organization in 
castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Biochemistry, University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States.

Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death and affects 
millions of men in the world. The American Cancer Society estimated about 34,500 
deaths from prostate cancer in the United States in year 2022. The Androgen 
receptor (AR) signaling is a major pathway that sustains local and metastatic 
prostate tumor growth. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of 
care for metastatic prostate cancer patient and can suppress the tumor growth 
for a median of 2-3 years. Unfortunately, the malignancy inevitably progresses 
to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) which is more aggressive and no 
longer responsive to ADT. Surprisingly, for most of the CPRC patients, cancer 
growth still depends on androgen receptor signaling. Accumulating evidence 
suggests that CRPC cells have rewired their transcriptional program to retain AR 
signaling in the absence of androgens. Besides AR, other transcription factors 
also contribute to the resistance mechanism through multiple pathways including 
enhancing AR signaling pathway and activating other complementary signaling 
pathways for the favor of AR downstream genes expression. More recent studies 
have shown the role of transcription factors in reconfiguring chromatin 3D 
structure and regulating topologically associating domains (TADs). Pioneer 
factors, transcription factors and coactivators form liquid-liquid phase 
separation compartment that can modulate transcriptional events along with 
configuring TADs. The role of AR and other transcription factors on chromatin 
structure change and formation of condensate compartment in prostate cancer 
cells has only been recently investigated and appreciated. This review intends 
to provide an overview of transcription factors that contribute to AR signaling 
through activation of gene expression, governing 3D chromatin structure and 
establishing phase to phase separation. A more detailed understanding of the 
spatial role of transcription factors in CRPC might provide novel therapeutic 
targets for the treatment of CRPC.

Although it is known that RNA undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, the 
interplay between the molecular driving forces and the emergent features of the 
condensates, such as their morphologies and dynamic properties, is not well 
understood. We introduce a coarse-grained model to simulate phase separation of 
trinucleotide repeat RNAs, which are implicated in neurological disorders. After 
establishing that the simulations reproduce key experimental findings, we show 
that once recruited inside the liquid droplets, the monomers transition from 
hairpin-like structures to extended states. Interactions between the monomers in 
the condensates result in the formation of an intricate and dense intermolecular 
network, which severely restrains the fluctuations and mobilities of the RNAs 
inside large droplets. In the largest densely packed high-viscosity droplets, 
the mobility of RNA chains is best characterized by reptation, reminiscent of 
the dynamics in polymer melts. Our work provides a microscopic framework for 
understanding liquid-liquid phase separation in RNA, which is not easily 
discernible in current experiments.

We suggest a simple model to describe polyamorphism in single-component fluids 
using a maximum-valence approach. The model contains three types of 
interactions: (i) Atoms attract each other by van der Waals forces that generate 
a liquid-gas transition at low pressures, (ii) atoms may form covalent bonds 
that induce association, and (iii) atoms with maximal valence attract or repel 
each other stronger than other atoms, thus generating liquid-liquid separation. 
As an example, we qualitatively compare this model with the behavior of liquid 
sulfur and show that condition (iii) generates a liquid-liquid phase transition 
in addition to the liquid-gas phase transition.

In this study, a new pH-induced dispersive solid-phase extraction method using 
folic acid has been proposed for the extraction of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions from 
water and fruit juice samples. For this purpose, at first, a specified amount of 
folic acid was dissolved in the sample solution containing the studied ions at 
pH 8.5. Then, by decreasing pH of the solution, solubility of folic acid reduced 
and its fine particles containing the analytes were produced. They were 
separated and dissolved in dimethylformamide. For more preconcentration, the 
developed procedure was combined with a dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 
procedure. Finally, the extracted and enriched analytes were determined by flame 
atomic absorption spectrometry. The effect of important parameters on the 
extraction efficiency of the method such as pH, folic acid amount, the amount of 
complexing agent, dimethylformamide volume, ionic strength, and centrifugation 
conditions were studied. Under optimized conditions, the developed method showed 
linear ranges of 0.20-40 and 0.25-40 µg L-1 for Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions, 
respectively. Limits of detection of Pb(II) and Cu(II) were 0.07 and 
0.08 µg L-1, respectively. The relative standard deviations (intra- and 
inter-day precisions) were between 3.8 and 5.4%. Accuracy of the proposed method 
was studied by determination of the analytes concentrations in a certified 
reference material; SPS-WW2 Batch 108. Efficiency of the proposed procedure was 
evaluated by analyzing Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions in various water and fruit juice 
samples.

Evolution of composition, rheology, and morphology during phase separation in 
complex fluids is highly coupled to rheological and mass transport processes 
within the emerging phases, and understanding this coupling is critical for 
materials design of multiphase complex fluids. Characterizing these dependencies 
typically requires careful measurement of a large number of equilibrium and 
transport properties that are difficult to measure in situ as phase separation 
proceeds. Here, we propose and demonstrate a high-throughput microscopy platform 
to achieve simultaneous, in situ mapping of time-evolving morphology and 
microrheology in phase separating complex fluids over a large compositional 
space. The method was applied to a canonical example of polyelectrolyte complex 
coacervation, whereby mixing of oppositely charged species leads to 
liquid-liquid phase separation into distinct solute-dense and dilute phases. 
Morphology and rheology were measured simultaneously and kinetically after 
mixing to track the progression of phase separation. Once equilibrated, the 
dense phase viscosity was determined to high compositional accuracy using 
passive probe microrheology, and the results were used to derive empirical 
relationships between the composition and viscosity. These relationships were 
inverted to reconstruct the dense phase boundary itself, and further extended to 
other mixture compositions. The resulting predictions were validated by 
independent equilibrium compositional measurements. This platform paves the way 
for rapid screening and formulation of complex fluids and (bio)macromolecular 
materials, and serves as a critical link between formulation and rheology for 
multi-phase material discovery.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) function in RNA processing, 
have RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and intrinsically disordered, low-complexity 
domains (LCDs). While RRMs are drivers of RNA binding, there is only limited 
knowledge about the RNA interaction by the LCD of some hnRNPs. Here, we show 
that the LCD of hnRNPA2 interacts with RNA via an embedded Tyr/Gly-rich region 
which is a disordered RNA-binding motif. RNA binding is maintained upon mutating 
tyrosine residues to phenylalanines, but abrogated by mutating to alanines, thus 
we term the RNA-binding region 'F/YGG motif'. The F/YGG motif can bind a broad 
range of structured (e.g. tRNA) and disordered (e.g. polyA) RNAs, but not rRNA. 
As the F/YGG otif can also interact with DNA, we consider it a general nucleic 
acid-binding motif. hnRNPA2 LCD can form dense droplets, by liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS). Their formation is inhibited by RNA binding, which is 
mitigated by salt and 1,6-hexanediol, suggesting that both electrostatic and 
hydrophobic interactions feature in the F/YGG motif. The D290V mutant also binds 
RNA, which interferes with both LLPS and aggregation thereof. We found 
homologous regions in a broad range of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins in the 
human proteome, suggesting that the F/YGG motif is a general nucleic 
acid-interaction motif.

The regulation of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription requires a complex 
and context-specific array of proteins and protein complexes, as well as nucleic 
acids and metabolites. Every major physiological process requires coordinated 
transcription of specific sets of genes at the appropriate time, and a breakdown 
in this regulation is a hallmark of human disease. A proliferation of recent 
studies has revealed that many general transcription components, including 
sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors, Mediator, and pol II 
itself, are capable of liquid-liquid phase separation, to form condensates that 
partition these factors away from the bulk aqueous phase. These findings hold 
great promise for next-level understanding of pol II transcription; however, 
many mechanistic aspects align with more conventional models, and whether phase 
separation per se regulates pol II activity in cells remains controversial. In 
this review, we describe the conventional and condensate-dependent models, and 
why their similarities and differences are important. We also compare and 
contrast these models in the context of genome organization and pol II 
transcription (initiation, elongation, and termination), and highlight the 
central role of RNA in these processes. Finally, we discuss mutations that 
disrupt normal partitioning of transcription factors, and how this may 
contribute to disease.

Liquid-liquid phase separation has emerged as an important means of 
intracellular RNA compartmentalization. Some membraneless organelles host two or 
more compartments serving different putative biochemical roles. The mechanisms 
for, and functional consequences of, this subcompartmentalization are not yet 
well understood. Here we show that adjacent phases of decapeptide-based 
multiphase model membraneless organelles differ markedly in their interactions 
with RNA. Single- and double-stranded RNAs preferentially accumulate in 
different phases within the same droplet, and one phase is more destabilizing 
for RNA duplexes than the other. Single-phase peptide droplets did not capture 
this behaviour. Phase coexistence introduces new thermodynamic equilibria that 
alter RNA duplex stability and RNA sorting by hybridization state. These effects 
require neither biospecific RNA-binding sites nor full-length proteins. As such, 
they are more general and point to primitive versions of mechanisms operating in 
extant biology that could aid understanding and enable the design of functional 
artificial membraneless organelles.

An aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) is a system with liquid-liquid phase 
separation and shows great potential for the extraction, separation, 
purification, and enrichment of proteins, membranes, viruses, enzymes, nucleic 
acids, and other biomolecules because of its simplicity, biocompatibility, and 
wide applicability [1-4]. The clear aqueous-aqueous interface of ATPSs is highly 
advantageous for their implementation, therefore making ATPSs a green 
alternative approach to replace conventional emulsion systems, such as 
water-in-oil droplets. All aqueous emulsions (water-in-water, w-in-w) hold great 
promise in the biomedical field as glucose sensors [5] and promising carriers 
for the encapsulation and release of various biomolecules and nonbiomolecules 
[6-10]. However, the ultralow interfacial tension between the two phases is a 
hurdle in generating w-in-w emulsion droplets. In the past, bulk emulsification 
and electrospray techniques were employed for the generation of w-in-w emulsion 
droplets and the fabrication of microparticles and microcapsules in the later 
stage. Bulk emulsification is a simple and low-cost technique; however, it 
generates polydisperse w-in-w emulsion droplets. Another technique, 
electrospray, involves easy experimental setups that can generate monodisperse 
but nonspherical w-in-w emulsion droplets. In comparison, microfluidic platforms 
provide monodisperse w-in-w emulsion droplets with spherical shapes, deal with 
the small volumes of solutions and short reaction times and achieve portability 
and versatility in their design through rapid prototyping. Owing to several 
advantages, microfluidic approaches have recently been introduced. To date, 
several different strategies have been explored to generate w-in-w emulsions and 
multiple w-in-w emulsions and to fabricate microparticles and microcapsules 
using conventional microfluidic devices. Although a few review articles on ATPSs 
emulsions have been published in the past, to date, few reviews have exclusively 
focused on the evolution of microfluidic-based ATPS droplets. The present review 
begins with a brief discussion of the history of ATPSs and their fundamentals, 
which is followed by an account chronicling the integration of microfluidic 
devices with ATPSs to generate w-in-w emulsion droplets. Furthermore, the 
stabilization strategies of w-in-w emulsion droplets and microfluidic 
fabrication of microparticles and microcapsules for modern applications, such as 
biomolecule encapsulation and spheroid construction, are discussed in detail in 
this review. We believe that the present review will provide useful information 
to not only new entrants in the microfluidic community wanting to appreciate the 
findings of the field but also existing researchers wanting to keep themselves 
updated on progress in the field.

Towards Predicting Partitioning of Enzymes between Macromolecular Phases: 
Effects of Polydispersity on the Phase Behavior of Nonadditive Hard Spheres in 
Solution.

The ability to separate enzymes, or cells or viruses, from a mixture is 
important and can be realized by the incorporation of the mixture into a 
macromolecular solution. This incorporation may lead to a spontaneous phase 
separation, with one phase containing the majority of one of the species of 
interest. Inspired by this phenomenon, we studied the theoretical phase behavior 
of a model system composed of an asymmetric binary mixture of hard spheres, of 
which the smaller component was monodisperse and the larger component was 
polydisperse. The interactions were modeled in terms of the second virial 
coefficient and could be additive hard sphere (HS) or nonadditive hard sphere 
(NAHS) interactions. The polydisperse component was subdivided into two 
subcomponents and had an average size ten or three times the size of the 
monodisperse component. We gave the set of equations that defined the phase 
diagram for mixtures with more than two components in a solvent. We calculated 
the theoretical liquid-liquid phase separation boundary for the two-phase 
separation (the binodal) and three-phase separation, the plait point, and the 
spinodal. We varied the distribution of the polydisperse component in skewness 
and polydispersity, and we varied the nonadditivity between the subcomponents as 
well as between the main components. We compared the phase behavior of the 
polydisperse mixtures with binary monodisperse mixtures for the same average 
size and binary monodisperse mixtures for the same effective interaction. We 
found that when the compatibility between the polydisperse subcomponents 
decreased, the three-phase separation became possible. The shape and position of 
the phase boundary was dependent on the nonadditivity between the subcomponents 
as well as their size distribution. We conclude that it is the phase enriched in 
the polydisperse component that demixes into an additional phase when the 
incompatibility between the subcomponents increases.

Spatiotemporal organization of distinct biological processes in cytomimetic 
compartments is a crucial step towards engineering functional artificial cells. 
Mimicking controlled bi-directional molecular communication inside artificial 
cells remains a considerable challenge. Here we present photoswitchable 
molecular transport between programmable membraneless organelle-like DNA 
coacervates in a synthetic microcompartment. We use droplet microfluidics to 
fabricate membraneless non-fusing DNA coacervates by liquid-liquid phase 
separation in a water-in-oil droplet, and employ the interior DNA coacervates as 
artificial organelles to imitate intracellular communication via photo-regulated 
uni- and bi-directional transfer of biomolecules. Our results highlight a 
promising new route to assembly of multicompartment artificial cells with 
functional networks.

Recombinant protein expression in E. coli often induces the expressed protein to 
accumulate in insoluble aggregates, named inclusion bodies (IBs), that represent 
easy to isolate, highly pure protein reservoirs. IBs can be solubilized by 
denaturing agents but this procedure requires, for complex globular proteins, a 
refolding step that can be challenging. However, the lack of cooperatively 
folded tertiary structure in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) makes them 
ideal candidates for this purification strategy. Given the wide abundance of 
IDPs, their relevance in many disease areas and the numerous IDP-associated 
biological functions, the interest in this class of proteins has increased 
substantially over the last decade. Here we present a broad and versatile method 
for the production and isolation of IDPs from inclusion bodies under denaturant 
conditions that overcomes the challenges associated with the propensity of these 
sequences to precipitate from solution and becoming proteolytically degraded.

Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to regulatory DNA and 
recruiting regulatory protein complexes. The DNA-binding and protein-binding 
functions of transcription factors are traditionally described as independent 
functions performed by modular protein domains. Here, I argue that genome 
binding can be a 2-part process with both DNA-binding and protein-binding steps, 
enabling transcription factors to perform a 2-step search of the nucleus to find 
their appropriate binding sites in a eukaryotic genome. I support this 
hypothesis with new and old results in the literature, discuss how this 
hypothesis parsimoniously resolves outstanding problems, and present testable 
predictions.

CTD of SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a cryptic domain for binding ATP and nucleic acid 
that interplay in modulating phase separation.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein plays essential roles in many steps of the 
viral life cycle, thus representing a key drug target. N protein contains the 
folded N-/C-terminal domains (NTD/CTD) and three intrinsically disordered 
regions, while its functions including liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
depend on the capacity in binding various viral/host-cell RNA/DNA of diverse 
sequences. Previously NTD was established to bind various RNA/DNA while CTD to 
dimerize/oligomerize for forming high-order structures. By NMR, here for the 
first time we decrypt that CTD is not only capable of binding S2m, a specific 
probe derived from SARS-CoV-2 gRNA but with the affinity even higher than that 
of NTD. Very unexpectedly, ATP, the universal energy currency for all living 
cells with high cellular concentrations (2-16 mM), specifically binds CTD with 
Kd of 1.49 ± 0.28 mM. Strikingly, the ATP-binding residues of NTD/CTD are 
identical in the SARS-CoV-2 variants while ATP and S2m interplay in binding 
NTD/CTD, as well as in modulating LLPS critical for the viral life cycle. 
Results together not only define CTD as a novel binding domain for ATP and 
nucleic acid, but enforce our previous proposal that ATP has been evolutionarily 
exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to complete its life cycle in the host cell. Most 
importantly, the unique ATP-binding pockets on NTD/CTD may offer promising 
targets for design of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules to fight the pandemic. 
Fundamentally, ATP emerges to act at mM as a cellular factor to control the 
interface between the host cell and virus lacking the ability to generate ATP.

X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) is a powerful tool in the 
investigation of dynamics covering a broad time and length scale. It has been 
widely used to probe dynamics for systems in both equilibrium and 
non-equilibrium states; in particular, for systems undergoing a phase transition 
where the structural growth kinetics and the microscopic dynamics are strongly 
intertwined. The resulting time-dependent dynamic behavior can be described 
using the two-time correlation function (TTC), which, however, often contains 
more interesting features than the component along the diagonal, and cannot be 
easily interpreted via the classical simulation methods. Here, a reverse 
engineering (RE) approach is proposed based on particle-based heuristic 
simulations. This approach is applied to an XPCS measurement on a protein 
solution undergoing a liquid-liquid phase separation. It is demonstrated that 
the rich features of experimental TTCs can be well connected with the key 
control parameters including size distribution, concentration, viscosity and 
mobility of domains. The dynamic information obtained from this RE analysis goes 
beyond the existing theory. The RE approach established in this work is 
applicable for other processes such as film growth, coarsening or evolving 
systems.

The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging proposes that genes enhancing 
fitness in early life limit the lifespan, but the molecular evidence remains 
underexplored. By profiling translatome changes in Caenorhabditis elegans during 
starvation recovery, we find that an open reading frame (ORF) trl-1 “hidden” 
within an annotated pseudogene significantly translates upon refeeding. trl-1 
mutant animals increase brood sizes but shorten the lifespan and specifically 
impair germline deficiency–induced longevity. The loss of trl-1 abnormally 
up-regulates the translation of vitellogenin that produces copious yolk to 
provision eggs, whereas vitellogenin overexpression is known to reduce the 
lifespan. We show that the TRL-1 protein undergoes liquid–liquid phase 
separation (LLPS), through which TRL-1 granules recruit vitellogenin messenger 
RNA and inhibit its translation. These results indicate that trl-1 functions as 
an antagonistic pleiotropic gene to regulate the reproduction–longevity tradeoff 
by optimizing nutrient production for the next generation.

Under unfavorable environmental conditions, eukaryotic cells may form stress 
granules (SGs) in the cytosol to protect against injury and promote cell 
survival. The initiation, mRNA and protein composition, distribution and 
degradation of SGs are subject to multiple intracellular post‑translational 
modifications and signaling pathways to cope with stress damage. Despite 
accumulated comprehensive knowledge of their composition and dynamics, the 
function of SGs remains poorly understood. When the stress persists, aberrant 
and/or persistent intracellular SGs and aggregation of SGs‑related proteins may 
lead to various diseases. In the present article, the research progress 
regarding the generation, modification and function of SGs was reviewed. The 
regulatory effects and influencing factors of SGs in the development of tumors, 
cardiovascular diseases, viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases were 
also summarized, which may provide novel insight for preventing and treating 
SG‑related diseases.

A major pathogenic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of neurotoxic 
plaques composed of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides in patients' brains. The pathway 
of plaque formation remains elusive, though some clues appear to lie in the 
dominant presence of Aβ1 - 42 in these plaques despite Aβ1-40 making up 
approximately 90% of the Aβ pool. We hypothesize that this asymmetry is driven 
by the hydrophobicity of the two extra amino acids that are incorporated in 
Aβ1-42. To investigate this hypothesis at the level of single molecules, we have 
developed a molecular "sticker-and-spacer lattice model" of unfolded Aβ. The 
model protein has a single sticker that may reversibly dimerise and elongate 
into semi-flexible linear chains. The growth is hampered by excluded-volume 
interactions that are encoded by the hydrophilic spacers but are rendered 
cooperative by the attractive interactions of hydrophobic spacers. For 
sufficiently strong hydrophobicity, the chains undergo liquid-liquid 
phase-separation (LLPS) into condensates that facilitate the nucleation of 
fibers. We find that a small fraction of Aβ1-40 in a mixture of Aβ1-40 and 
Aβ1-42 shifts the critical concentration for LLPS to lower values. This study 
provides theoretical support for the hypothesis that LLPS condensates act as a 
precursor for aggregation and provides an explanation for the Aβ1-42-enrichment 
of aggregates in terms of hydrophobic interactions.

This paper presents a feasible and reliable phase transfer protocol for 
polyoxyethylene alkyl amine surfactant (AMIET)-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) 
in aqueous media to chloroform using a pH-triggered method, through the 
liquid-liquid interface. In the initial stage, the colloidal aqueous dispersion 
is destabilized by pH adjustment towards the isoelectric pH of the nanoparticle, 
which promotes the separation of the particles from water. We further explored a 
mechanistic view of this phase transfer phenomenon, considering the orientation 
of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties depending on the nature of the 
surrounding solvent. It was proposed that the AMIET molecules bound to the AuNPs 
undergo conformational changes through phase transfer. Ultraviolet visible 
absorption spectra before and after the phase transfer reveal that the original 
morphology and dispersion states of the particles were preserved.

To improve the efficiency of countercurrent chromatography (CCC) separations, we 
have previously proposed a new sample loading method called intermittent sample 
loading (ISL), in which continuous sample feed alternates with short periods of 
"clean" mobile phase feed to the CCC device. In semi-continuous separation 
processes, during sample feed periods, the sample is loaded in separate batches, 
each consisting of a series of intermittent sample loads. It was shown that the 
application of the intermittent sample loading method in the conventional 
isocratic CCC separations significantly increased process productivity and the 
concentration of compounds in the separated fractions. In this study, to further 
improve the CCC separations with intermittent sample loading, we discuss the 
application of the ISL method in the processes of close-loop recycling 
counter-current chromatography (CLR CCC). The advantage of the ISL CLR CCC over 
the ISL CCC is higher resolution and lower solvent consumption. Equations are 
presented that allow the simulation of periodic and semi-continuous ISL CLR CCC 
separations and the selection of optimal operational conditions for these 
separation processes. It is shown that the use of ISL technique in CLR CCC 
separations makes it possible to produce fractions of compounds with a much 
higher concentration than when using the conventional single sample loading 
method.

To deal with increasingly severe periods of dehydration related to global 
climate change, it becomes increasingly important to understand the complex 
strategies many organisms have developed to cope with dehydration and 
desiccation. While it is undisputed that late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) 
proteins play a key role in the tolerance of plants and many anhydrobiotic 
organisms to water limitation, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. 
In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the physiological roles of LEA 
proteins and discuss their potential molecular functions. As these are 
ultimately linked to conformational changes in the presence of binding partners, 
post-translational modifications, or water deprivation, we provide a detailed 
summary of current knowledge on the structure-function relationship of LEA 
proteins, including their disordered state in solution, coil to helix 
transitions, self-assembly, and their recently discovered ability to undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation. We point out the promising potential of LEA 
proteins in biotechnological and agronomic applications, and summarize recent 
advances. We identify the most relevant open questions and discuss major 
challenges in establishing a solid understanding of how these intriguing 
molecules accomplish their tasks as cellular sentinels at the limits of 
surviving water scarcity.

FUS is a multifunctional nuclear protein which undergoes liquid-liquid phase 
separation in response to stress and DNA damage. Dysregulation of FUS dynamic 
phase separation leads to formation of pathological fibril closely associated 
with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
frontotemporal dementia. In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a 
cytotoxic fibril formed by the low-complexity (LC) domain of FUS at 2.9 Å 
resolution. The fibril structure exhibits a new and extensive serpentine fold 
consisting of three motifs incorporating together via a Tyr triad. FUS LC 
employs 91 residues to form an enlarged and stable fibril core via hydrophilic 
interaction and hydrogen bonds, which is distinct from most of previously 
determined fibrils commonly stabilized by hydrophobic interaction. Our work 
reveals the structural basis underlying formation of a cytotoxic and 
thermostable fibril of FUS LC and sheds light on understanding the 
liquid-to-solid phase transition of FUS in disease.

[Progress in sample pretreatment and detection methods of 
hexabromocyclododecanes].

[Article in Chinese]

Hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) are a group of brominated flame retardants that 
are extensively employed in the industrial production of plastics, furniture, 
and construction materials. Due to their regular use and massive emissions, 
HBCDs have been distributed in the environment (air, water, soil, and 
sediments). Due to their high toxicity, persistent and long-distance transport, 
and bioaccumulation, HBCDs were listed in the Stockholm Convention in 2013. 
Thus, the accurate analysis and strict control of the pollution levels of HBCDs 
in environmental samples are critical to the government's long-term 
environmental supervision mechanism. However, the concentration levels of HBCDs 
in real samples are low, combined with complex matrices, which seriously limits 
the determination of HBCDs. The target isomers are particularly transformed or 
degraded, which makes analysis challenging due to the high temperatures and 
specific organic solvents. The physicochemical features, toxic and environmental 
dangers, usage, and standard limitations of HBCDs are briefly discussed herein. 
Sample pretreatment and instrument detection of HBCDs in various matrices are 
summarized (i. e., soil, sediment, food, electronics, atmosphere, animals, and 
water). More than 70 research papers (2000-2022) from the Science Citation Index 
(SCI) and Chinese core publications are cited herein. First, the entire process 
of extraction, purification, separation, and enrichment of HBCDs is compared, 
including soxhlet extraction (SE), ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), 
accelerated solvent extraction(ASE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid 
phase extraction (SPE), dispersed solid phase extraction (DSPE), liquid-liquid 
extraction (LLE), dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME), and solid 
phase microextraction (SPME). In the literature, UAE is the most commonly 
employed process, accounting for a quarter of all HBCDs sample pretreatments. 
Additionally, SPE sample pretreatment technology can completely separate the 
targets and impurities to reduce the effect of matrix; and enrich the targets to 
improve sensitivity of method. By using SPE technology, the enrichment factor 
can be increased due to the massive sample volume, thus enabling detect HBCDs 
concentrations (nanogram per liter level) in water. Second, the advantages and 
disadvantages of instrument approaches are examined and discussed, including gas 
chromatography (GC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid 
chromatography (LC), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS), which offer a reference for meeting the requirements in the 
determination of HBCDs in real samples, i. e., the total HBCDs can be detected 
by GC or GC-MS and three HBCD isomers (α-HBCD, β-HBCD, γ-HBCD) can be determined 
by LC or LC-MS. By using the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, the 
sensitivity of the method can be improved. Till date, LC-MS/MS has been chosen 
as an instrument for the determination of HBCDs in various matrices (i. e., 
seawater, marine sediment, marine organisms, toys, and electronic products) in 
China. However, there are several challenges. The sample pretreatment is 
tedious; large sample volumes and organic solvent utilization. These challenges 
point to the development trends of analytical approaches for HBCDs. The 
development of green, automated, low-cost, fast, and efficient sample 
pretreatment approaches for new adsorption materials is the main development 
direction in the analysis of HBCDs in the future.

作为一种常见的溴代阻燃剂,六溴环十二烷(HBCDs)因具备持久性、长距离迁移性、生物蓄积性和高毒性,于2013年被列入《斯德哥尔摩公约》。因此,环境样品中HBCDs污染水平的准确分析和严格控制对完善环境监管长效机制至关重要。然而,实际样品中HBCDs的定性定量分析正面临着基质复杂、目标物含量低等问题。尤其,HBCDs在高温环境及特定有机溶剂中易降解,会产生异构体,提高了分析难度。该综述简述了HBCDs的理化性质、毒性危害和标准限制,重点围绕不同基质中HBCDs的样品前处理和仪器检测两方面进行了总结。论文内容引用2000~2022年的70余篇源于科学引文索引(SCI)与中文核心期刊中的相关论文。总结归纳了固体和液体样品中HBCDs分析的前处理技术,包括索式提取、超声辅助萃取、加速溶剂萃取、超临界流体萃取、液液萃取、分散液液微萃取、固相萃取、分散固相萃取和固相微萃取等,介绍了气相色谱、液相色谱和色谱-质谱联用技术等仪器检测方法在HBCDs分析中的应用。通过综述近期相关研究,侧面表明HBCDs的分析方法研究发展迅速,但也面临一些挑战,如样品前处理步骤繁琐、耗时长、样品量和有机溶剂用量大等问题。最后,对新型样品前处理技术在HBCDs分析中的应用进行了展望。

BACKGROUND: Pesticides are widely used to control pests and prevent diseases in 
crops, including cereals, vegetables, and fruits. Due to factors such as the 
persistence of pesticides, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity, pesticide 
residue monitoring in foodstuffs is very important.
OBJECTIVE: In the current research, we proposed a novel approach using 
countercurrent salting-out homogenous liquid-liquid extraction combined with 
dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on the solidification of floating 
organic droplets (DLLME-SFO) for isolation and preconcentration of pesticides 
from aqueous samples for analysis by high-performance liquid 
chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV).
METHODS: In brief, sodium chloride was used as a separation reagent, in a small 
glass column, through which was passed a mixture of an aqueous solution of, for 
example, fruit juice and acetonitrile. In this process, the droplets rose 
through the column and a separated layer would be formed on the remained an 
aqueous phase. Following that, acetonitrile as the organic phase was mixed with 
50.0 µL of 1-undecanol (extraction solvent). To further enrich the analytes, the 
mixture was injected into 5 mL of a 4% w/v sodium chloride solution and placed 
in a tube for the DLLME-SFO.
RESULTS: Under optimal conditions, a dynamic linear range of 0.5-500 μg/L, 
extraction recovery of 65-85%, enrichment factors of 108-142, and limit of 
detection of 0.2-0.4 μg/L were obtained for the organophosphorus pesticides 
analysed. In addition, the repeatability and reproducibility from five replicate 
measurements of the pesticides (100 μg/L) were within the ranges of 3.5-5.1% and 
4.5-6.3%, respectively .
CONCLUSION: In this research, a new extraction method based on countercurrent 
salting out homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction combined with DLLME-SFO has 
been applied for the determination of pesticide residues in fruits, juice and 
environmental samples before using HPLC-UV analysis. The combined method not 
only leads to high enrichment factors, but can also be used in complex matrices 
(such as fruits, juices and high-salt solutions) without pre-treatment or 
dilution. Compared with other sample preparation methods, this analysis 
procedure has many advantages, including simplicity, ease of operation, high 
pre-enrichment factor, low detection limit and relatively short analysis time.
HIGHLIGHTS: Combination of CCSHLLE and DLLME-SFO was applied for the analysis of 
organophosphorous pesticide residues in fruit, fruit juices and environmental 
samples. The DLLME-SFO method avoided using high density and toxic extraction 
solvents. LODs are achievable at ng L-1 using CCSLLE-DLLME-SFO-HPLC-UV.

Cyclodextrin-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (CD-DLLME) was 
developed for the determination of triazole and strobilurin fungicides in water, 
juice, and vinegar samples using high-performance liquid 
chromatography-diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD). Undecanol, which is a green 
solvent, was selected as the extraction solvent. A cyclodextrin aqueous solution 
was chosen as the dispersion solvent and demulsifier to avoid the use of a toxic 
dispersion solvent and eliminate the centrifugation step. Dispersion and phase 
separation were completed within 1 and 60 s, respectively. The linear range of 
this method was 1 to 100 µg L-1. The limits of detection were 0.3 μg L-1 along 
with the preconcentration factor of 133 and enrichment factor of 124. The 
recovery was 83.2% to 103.2%. This pretreatment method was fast, simple, and 
environmentally friendly and was successfully applied to the analysis of 
triazole and strobilurin fungicide residues in water, juice, and vinegar 
samples.

Supramolecular self-assembly of fibrous components and liquid-liquid phase 
separation are at the extremes of the order-to-disorder spectrum. They 
collectively play key roles in cellular organization. It is still a major 
challenge to design systems where both highly ordered nanostructures and 
liquid-liquid phase-separated domains can coexist. We present a three-component 
assembly approach that generates fibrous domains that exclusively form inside 
globally disordered, liquid condensates. This is achieved by creating 
amphiphilic peptides that combine the features of fibrillar assembly (the 
amyloid domain LVFFA) and complex coacervation (oligo-arginine and adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP)) in one peptide, namely, LVFFAR9. When this hybrid peptide is 
mixed in different ratios with R9 and ATP, we find that conditions can be 
created where fibrous assembly is exclusively observed inside liquid 
coacervates. Through fluorescence and atomic force microscopy characterization, 
we investigate the dynamic evolution of ordered and disordered features over 
time. It was observed that the fibers nucleate and mature inside the droplets 
and that these fiber-containing liquid droplets can also undergo fusion, showing 
that the droplets remain liquid-like. Our work thus generates opportunities for 
the design of ordered structures within the confined environment of biomolecular 
condensates, which may be useful to create supramolecular materials in defined 
compartments and as model systems that can enhance understanding of ordering 
principles in biology.

The membraneless organelles (MLOs) play a key role in the cell, yet it is 
unclear what controls the morphology and dynamics of MLOs in crowded cell 
medium. Using a biphasic coacervate droplet as a model of MLO, we online 
monitored the liquid-liquid phase separation process in crowded medium provided 
by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) or dextran. In PEO solution, which has an affinity 
with the inner phase, the spherical droplets evolve into clusters, networks, and 
completely phase inverted spheres in sequence with increasing PEO concentration, 
while in dextran solution, which has an affinity with the outer phase, the 
coacervates maintain the morphology but vary in phase ratio. Flower-like and 
even Janus structures are formed in the mixed PEO/dextran medium. Our work 
demonstrates that MLOs could be controlled solely by the crowded cell medium.

An effervescent tablet-assisted switchable polarity solvent-based homogeneous 
liquid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography with flame 
ionization detection has been conducted for the separation, preconcentration, 
and detection of permethrin and deltamethrin in the river water specimens. 
Triethylamine (TEA) was utilized as the switchable polarity solvent in this 
method. The switching process was carried out by the dissolution of an 
effervescent tablet including an effervescency agent (sodium carbonate) and a 
proton donor agent (citric acid). Changing the pH of the specimen solution 
enhanced the conversion of TEA into protonated triethylamine carbonate through 
the tablet that generated carbon dioxide bubbles in situ. Finally, the addition 
of sodium hydroxide changed the ionization state of TEA and separated the two 
phases. Influential factors in the extraction were investigated. According to 
optimal situations, the limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 
0.16 and 0.5 μg L-1 for permethrin and 0.03 and 0.1 μg L-1 for deltamethrin, 
respectively. The preconcentration factor was 194 in river water samples and 
inter- and intra-day precision (relative standard deviation %; n = 5) was <5%. 
The extraction recovery was obtained in the range of 93.0%-97% for permethrin 
and deltamethrin in water samples.

Photocatalytic molecular conversions that lead to value-added chemicals are of 
considerable interest. To achieve highly efficient photocatalytic reactions, it 
is equally important as it is challenging to construct systems that enable 
effective charge separation. Here, we demonstrate that the rational construction 
of a biphasic solution system with a ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) redox couple 
enables efficient photocatalysis by spatial charge separation using the 
liquid-liquid interface. In a single-phase system, exposure of a 
1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solution containing a Ru(II)- or Ir(III)-based 
photosensitizer, Fc, and benzyl bromide (Bn-Br) to visible-light irradiation 
failed to generate any product. However, the photolysis in a H2O/DCE biphasic 
solution, where the compounds are initially distributed in the DCE phase, 
facilitated the reductive coupling of Bn-Br to dibenzyl (Bn2) using Fc as an 
electron donor. The key result of this study is that Fc+, generated by 
photooxidation of Fc in the DCE phase, migrates to the aqueous phase due to the 
drastic change in its partition coefficient compared to that of Fc. This 
liquid-liquid phase migration of the mediator is essential for facilitating the 
reduction of Bn-Br in the DCE phase as it suppresses backward charge 
recombination. The co-existence of anions can further modify the driving force 
of phase migration of Fc+ depending on their hydrophilicity; the best 
photocatalytic activity was obtained with a turnover frequency of 79.5 h-1 and a 
quantum efficiency of 0.2% for the formation of Bn2 by adding NBu4+Br- to the 
biphasic solution. This study showcases a potential approach for rectifying 
electron transfer with suppressed charge recombination to achieve efficient 
photocatalysis.

Enzymes within the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway spatially organize into 
dynamic intracellular assemblies called purinosomes. The formation of 
purinosomes has been correlated with growth conditions resulting in high purine 
demand, and therefore, the cellular advantage of complexation has been 
hypothesized to enhance metabolite flux through the pathway. However, the 
properties of this cellular structure are unclear. Here, we define the 
purinosome in a transient expression system as a biomolecular condensate using 
fluorescence microscopy. We show that purinosomes, as denoted by 
formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase granules in purine-depleted HeLa 
cells, are spherical and appear to coalesce when two come into contact, all 
liquid-like characteristics that are consistent with previously reported 
condensates. We further explored the biophysical and biochemical means that 
drive the liquid-liquid phase separation of these structures. We found that the 
process of enzyme condensation into purinosomes is likely driven by the 
oligomeric state of the pathway enzymes and not a result of intrinsic disorder, 
the presence of low-complexity domains, the assistance of RNA scaffolds, or 
changes in intracellular pH. Finally, we demonstrate that the heat shock protein 
90 KDa helps to regulate the physical properties of the condensate and maintain 
their liquid-like state inside HeLa cells. We show that disruption of heat shock 
protein 90 KDa activity induced the transformation of formylglycinamidine 
ribonucleotide synthase clusters into more irregularly shaped condensates, 
suggesting that its chaperone activity is essential for purinosomes to retain 
their liquid-like properties. This refined view of the purinosome offers new 
insight into how metabolic enzymes spatially organize into dynamic condensates 
within human cells.

In 1972, the Weber statement, "The multiplicity of interactions and the variety 
of effects that follow from them show that multimer proteins are unlikely to be 
limited to a minimal number of allowed conformations," first addressed the 
dynamic nature of proteins. This idea serves as a foundation for understanding 
why several macromolecules, such as p53, exhibit the properties of a molecular 
chameleon. Functionally competent states comprise a myriad of p53 
three-dimensional arrangements depending on the stimuli. For instance, the 
interaction of p53 with nuclear components could induce liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) and the formation of membraneless organelles. The functional 
or deleterious role of p53 in liquid droplets is still unclear. Functional 
aspects display p53 interconverting between droplets and tetramer with its 
functional abilities maintained. In contrast, the aberrant phase separation is 
likely to fuel the aggregation path, usually associated with the onset and 
progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here, we 
gathered the most relevant aspects that lead p53 to phase separation and the 
resulting structural effects, attempting to understand p53's functional and 
disease-relevant processes. Aberrant phase separation and aggregation of mutant 
p53 have become important therapeutic targets against cancer.

Eukaryotic genome DNA is wrapped around core histones and forms a nucleosome 
structure. Together with associated proteins and RNAs, these nucleosomes are 
organized three-dimensionally in the cell as chromatin. Emerging evidence 
demonstrates that chromatin consists of rather irregular and variable nucleosome 
arrangements without the regular fiber structure and that its dynamic behavior 
plays a critical role in regulating various genome functions. Single-nucleosome 
imaging is a promising method to investigate chromatin behavior in living cells. 
It reveals local chromatin motion, which reflects chromatin organization not 
observed in chemically fixed cells. The motion data is like a gold mine. Data 
analyses from many aspects bring us more and more information that contributes 
to better understanding of genome functions. In this review article, we describe 
imaging of single-nucleosomes and their tracked behavior through oblique 
illumination microscopy. We also discuss applications of this technique, 
especially in elucidating nucleolar organization in living cells.

Developing artificial microsystems based on liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) to mimic cellular dynamic compartmentalization has gained increasing 
attention. However, limitations including complicated components and laborious 
fabrication techniques have hindered their development. Herein, we describe a 
new single-component dynamic compartmentalization system using 
peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates (POCs) produced from short elastin-like 
polypeptides (sELPs) and oligonucleotides (ONs), which can perform 
thermoreversible phase transition between a nanovesicle and a microdroplet. The 
phase transition of sELP-ONs is thoroughly investigated, of which the transition 
temperature can be controlled by concentration, length of sELPs and ONs, base 
sequences, and salt. Moreover, the sELP-ON microcompartment can enrich a variety 
of functional molecules including small molecules, polysaccharides, proteins, 
and nucleic acids. Two sELP-ON compartments are used as nano- and microreactors 
for enzymatic reactions, separately, in which chemical activities are 
successfully regulated under different-scaled confinement effects, demonstrating 
their broad potential application in matter exchange and artificial cells.

A non-canonical DNA/RNA structure, G-quadruplex (G4), is a unique structure 
formed by two or more guanine quartets, which associate through Hoogsteen 
hydrogen bonding leading to form a square planar arrangement. A set of 
RNA-binding proteins specifically recognize G4 structures and play certain 
unique physiological roles. These G4-binding proteins form ribonucleoprotein 
(RNP) through a physicochemical phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS). G4-containing RNP granules are identified in both prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes, but extensive studies have been performed in eukaryotes. We have 
been involved in analyses of the roles of G4-containing RNAs recognized by two 
G4-RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, which both are the amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) causative gene products. These RNA-binding proteins play the 
essential roles in both G4 recognition and LLPS, but they also carry the risk of 
agglutination. The biological significance of G4-binding proteins is controlled 
through unique 3D structure of G4, of which the risk of conformational stability 
is influenced by environmental conditions such as monovalent metals and guanine 
oxidation.

Amyloid aggregation of α-synuclein (αS) is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease 
and other synucleinopathies. Recently, Tau protein, generally associated with 
Alzheimer's disease, has been linked to αS pathology and observed to co-localize 
in αS-rich disease inclusions, although the molecular mechanisms for the 
co-aggregation of both proteins remain elusive. We report here that αS 
phase-separates into liquid condensates by electrostatic complex coacervation 
with positively charged polypeptides such as Tau. Condensates undergo either 
fast gelation or coalescence followed by slow amyloid aggregation depending on 
the affinity of αS for the poly-cation and the rate of valence exhaustion of the 
condensate network. By combining a set of advanced biophysical techniques, we 
have been able to characterize αS/Tau liquid-liquid phase separation and 
identified key factors that lead to the formation of hetero-aggregates 
containing both proteins in the interior of the liquid protein condensates.

Hypertension and dyslipidemias are among the main risk factors for the 
development of cardiovascular diseases, which are responsible for the death of 
approximately 17 million people each year. There are several drugs available for 
the treatment of these diseases. Therefore, methods for the simultaneous 
analysis of several of these drugs are useful in a wide range of situations. In 
this context, this study aimed to develop a modern method for the simultaneous 
determination of eight cardiovascular drugs in human plasma. A vortex-assisted 
liquid-liquid microextraction (VALLME) procedure, combined with liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. Mass 
spectrometry conditions, chromatographic separation, and sample preparation were 
optimized. For VALLME optimization, pH, sodium chloride concentration, volume of 
buffer solution, extraction solvent (type and volume), and vortex stirring time 
were evaluated. The method proved to be simple, fast, and environmentally 
friendly since low volumes of organic solvent were employed. Furthermore, the 
VALLME procedure required small sample volume, which is desirable when large 
volumes are scarce. Suitable recoveries and lower limits of quantification were 
achieved with a chromatographic run of only 8 min. The method was validated, 
showing to be selective, precise, and accurate. Furthermore, the analytical 
curves were well fitted to the selected models and the matrix effect did not 
affect method reliability. The developed method was successfully applied for the 
analysis of plasma samples obtained from volunteers attending a hospital 
service.

The compartmentalised eukaryotic cell demands accurate targeting of proteins to 
the organelles in which they function, whether membrane-bound (like the nucleus) 
or non-membrane-bound (like the nucleolus). Nucleolar targeting relies on 
positively charged localisation signals and has received rejuvenated interest 
since the widespread recognition of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a 
mechanism contributing to nucleolus formation. Here, we exploit a new 
genome-wide analysis of protein localisation in the early-branching eukaryote 
Trypanosoma brucei to analyse general nucleolar protein properties. T. brucei 
nucleolar proteins have similar properties to those in common model eukaryotes, 
specifically basic amino acids. Using protein truncations and addition of 
candidate targeting sequences to proteins, we show both homopolymer runs and 
distributed basic amino acids give nucleolar partition, further aided by a 
nuclear localisation signal (NLS). These findings are consistent with phase 
separation models of nucleolar formation and physical protein properties being a 
major contributing mechanism for eukaryotic nucleolar targeting, conserved from 
the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Importantly, cytoplasmic ribosome proteins, 
unlike mitochondrial ribosome proteins, have more basic residues - pointing to 
adaptation of physicochemical properties to assist segregation.

In recent decades, a growing number of biomolecular condensates have been 
identified in eukaryotic cells. These structures form through phase separation 
and have been linked to a diverse array of cellular processes. While a checklist 
of established membrane-bound organelles is present across the eukaryotic 
domain, less is known about the conservation of membrane-less subcellular 
structures. Many of these structures can be seen throughout eukaryotes, while 
others are only thought to be present in metazoans or a limited subset of 
species. In particular, the nucleus is a hub of biomolecular condensates. Some 
of these subnuclear domains have been found in a broad range of organisms, which 
is a characteristic often attributed to essential functionality. However, this 
does not always appear to be the case. For example, the nucleolus is critical 
for ribosomal biogenesis and is present throughout the eukaryotic domain, while 
the Cajal bodies are believed to be similarly conserved, yet these structures 
are dispensable for organismal survival. Likewise, depletion of the Drosophila 
melanogaster omega speckles reduces viability, despite the apparent absence of 
this domain in higher eukaryotes. By reviewing primary research that has 
analyzed the presence of specific condensates (nucleoli, Cajal bodies, amyloid 
bodies, nucleolar aggresomes, nuclear speckles, nuclear paraspeckles, nuclear 
stress bodies, PML bodies, omega speckles, NUN bodies, mei2 dots) in a 
cross-section of organisms (e.g., human, mouse, D. melanogaster, Caenorhabditis 
elegans, yeast), we adopt a human-centric view to explore the emergence, 
retention, and absence of a subset of nuclear biomolecular condensates. This 
overview is particularly important as numerous biomolecular condensates have 
been linked to human disease, and their presence in additional species could 
unlock new and well characterized model systems for health research.

The heterogeneity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) makes it a versatile 
platform for a broad range of homeostatic processes, ranging from calcium 
regulation to synthesis and trafficking of proteins and lipids. It is not 
surprising that neurons use this organelle to fine-tune synaptic properties and 
thereby provide specificity to synaptic inputs. In this review, we discuss the 
mechanisms that enable activity-dependent ER recruitment into dendritic spines, 
with a focus on molecular mechanisms that mediate transport and retention of the 
ER in spines. The role of calcium signaling in spine ER, synaptopodin 'tagging' 
of active synapses, and the formation of the spine apparatus (SA) are 
highlighted. Finally, we discuss the role of liquid-liquid phase separation as a 
possible driving force in these processes.

Regulation, Gunma University.

Fertilization is the starting point for creating new progeny. At this time, the 
highly differentiated oocyte and sperm fuse to form one zygote, which is then 
converted into a pluripotent early embryo. Recent studies have shown that the 
lysosomal degradation system via autophagy and endocytosis plays important roles 
in the remodeling of intracellular components during oocyte-to-embryo 
transition. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans, zygotes show high endocytic 
activity, and some populations of maternal membrane proteins are selectively 
internalized and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Furthermore, 
fertilization triggers selective autophagy of sperm-derived paternal 
mitochondria, which establishes maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. In 
addition, it has been shown that autophagy via liquid-liquid phase separation 
results in the selective degradation of some germ granule components, which are 
distributed to somatic cells of early embryos. This review outlines the 
physiological functions of the lysosomal degradation system and its molecular 
mechanisms in C. elegans and mouse embryos.

phase separation and form complex coacervates, which play various regulatory 
roles in the cell. Recent experimental studies found that such phase separation 
processes may also occur at the lipid membrane surface and help organize 
biomolecules during signaling events; in some cases, phase separation of 
proteins at the membrane surface was also observed to lead to significant 
remodeling of the membrane morphology. The molecular mechanisms that govern the 
interactions between complex coacervates and lipid membranes and the impacts of 
such interactions on their structure and morphology, however, remain unclear. 
Here we study the coacervation of poly-glutamate (E30) and poly-lysine (K30) in 
the presence of lipid bilayers of different compositions. We carry out 
explicit-solvent coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations by using the 
MARTINI (v3.0) force-field. We find that more than 20% anionic lipids are 
required for the coacervate to form stable contact with the bilayer. Upon 
wetting, the coacervate induces negative curvature to the bilayer and 
facilitates local lipid demixing, without any peptide insertion. The magnitude 
of negative curvature, extent of lipid demixing, and asphericity of the 
coacervate increase with the concentration of anionic lipids. Overall, we 
observe a decrease in the number of contacts among the polyelectrolytes as the 
droplet spreads over the bilayer. Therefore, unlike previous suggestions, 
interactions among polyelectrolytes do not constitute a driving force for the 
membrane bending upon wetting by the coacervate. Rather, analysis of interaction 
energy components suggests that bending of the membrane is favored by enhanced 
interactions between polyelectrolytes with lipids as well as with counterions. 
Kinetic studies reveal that, at the studied polyelectrolyte concentrations, the 
coacervate formation precedes bilayer wetting.

A salting-out homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction was proposed for the 
quantification of four azole drugs in human urine prior to high-performance 
liquid chromatography analysis. The procedure involved the mixing of the sample 
with acetonitrile in appropriate volumes followed by the addition of sodium 
sulfate solution in order to facilitate phase separation. The parameters 
influencing the extraction performance were studied and optimized using a 
two-step experimental design. The analytical procedure was thoroughly validated 
using the accuracy profiles as a graphical decision-making tool. The 
β-expectation tolerance intervals did not exceed the acceptance criteria of ±15% 
meaning that 95% of future results will be included in the defined bias limits. 
The limits of detection of the procedure were satisfactory, ranging between 0.01 
and 0.03 μg/mL. The mean analytical bias in the spiking levels was satisfactory 
and ranged between -10.3 and 4.2% while the relative standard deviation was 
lower than 5.6%. Monte-Carlo simulations followed by capability analysis were 
employed to investigate the ruggedness of the sample preparation protocol. The 
developed method offers advantages compared to previously reported approaches 
for the same type of analysis including extraction efficiency and scaling down 
of the sample volume and extraction time.

In the present work, a magnetic ionic liquid (MIL) ([Co(DMBG)2][Co(hfaca)3]) was 
designed and synthesized with both the cation and anion respectively containing 
a paramagnetic component. With the prepared MIL as the extraction solvent, a 
vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-DLLME) method was 
developed and combined with back-extraction for the enrichment of five 
fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs). The MIL can be easily collected and separated 
from the aqueous phase under an external magnetic field due to the strong 
magnetic susceptibility and red color. Some experimental factors affecting the 
extraction efficiency were investigated, and the optimum extraction efficiency 
was obtained in a basic solution (pH=9) for the extraction process and with 2% 
(v/v) formic acid as the back-extraction solvent. Under the optimized extraction 
and back-extraction conditions, the proposed method was validated and exhibited 
good linearity with coefficients of determination (R2) above 0.9956 in the range 
of 2.5-800 ng·mL-1 and 5.0-800 ng·mL-1, low limits of detection (LODs) within 
0.75-1.5 ng·mL-1 and satisfactory intra-day and inter-day precisions with 
relative standard deviations (RSDs) respectively less than 10.6% and 8.6%. 
Finally, the method was applied for the determination of five FQs in four 
samples of tap water, milk, honey and chicken, and good precision with RSDs of 
0.5-9.5% and acceptable recoveries (73.8-114.3%) were obtained.

Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has crossed the 
18% mark for OSCs, which are largely fabricated by spin-coating, and the optimal 
photoactive thickness is limited to 100 nm. To increase reproducibility of 
results with industrial roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, slot-die coating coupled 
with a ternary strategy for optimal performance of large-area, thick OSCs is 
used. Based on miscibility differences, a highly crystalline molecule, BTR-Cl, 
is incorporated, and the phase-separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is 
regulated. BTR-Cl provides an early liquid-liquid phase separation and early 
aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and 
vertical phase separation of the ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% 
and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300 nm, 
respectively. The ternary design strategy for large-area and thick films is 
further used to fabricate high-efficiency flexible devices, which promises 
reproducibility of the lab results from slot-die coating to industrial R2R 
manufacturing.

Abnormal translation of the MYC proto-oncogene is a hallmark of the initiation 
and maintenance of tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying 
increased MYC protein levels in certain cancer types without a corresponding 
increase in MYC mRNA levels is unclear. Here, we identified a novel lncRNA, 
MTAR1, which is critical for post-transcriptional regulation of MYC-induced 
tumorigenesis. MTAR1 is essential for recruiting IGF2BPs into PABP1-mediated 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) complexes and facilitates IGF2BPs-mediated 
MYC mRNA translation. MTAR1 enhanced binding between IGF2BPs and PABP1, thereby 
promoting MYC mRNA stability and increased MYC mRNA translation. In summary, 
MTAR1 is a novel MYC-related lncRNA that contributes to tumor progression by 
enhancing MYC translation through mediating PABP1/IGF2BPs liquid-liquid phase 
separation.

Dynamic biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation can 
regulate the spatial and temporal organization of proteins, thus modulating 
their functional activity in cells. Previous studies showed that the cell 
division protein FtsZ from Escherichia coli formed dynamic phase-separated 
condensates with nucleoprotein complexes containing the FtsZ spatial regulator 
SlmA under crowding conditions, with potential implications for 
condensate-mediated spatiotemporal control of FtsZ activity in cell division. In 
the present study, we assessed formation of these condensates in the presence of 
lipid surfaces and glutamate ions to better approximate the E. coli 
intracellular environment. We found that potassium glutamate substantially 
promoted the formation of FtsZ-containing condensates when compared to potassium 
chloride in crowded solutions. These condensates accumulated on supported lipid 
bilayers and eventually fused, resulting in a time-dependent increase in the 
droplet size. Moreover, the accumulated condensates were dynamic, capturing 
protein from the external phase. FtsZ partitioned into the condensates at the 
lipid surface only in its guanosine diphosphate (GDP) form, regardless of 
whether it came from FtsZ polymer disassembly upon guanosine triphosphate (GTP) 
exhaustion. These results provide insights into the behavior of these 
GTP-responsive condensates in minimal membrane systems, which suggest how these 
membraneless assemblies may tune critical bacterial division events during the 
cell cycle.

Proper timing of flowering, a phase transition from vegetative to reproductive 
development, is crucial for plant fitness. The floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS 
C (FLC) is the major determinant of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. In 
rapid-cycling A. thaliana accessions, which bloom rapidly, FLC is constitutively 
repressed by autonomous pathway (AP) genes, regardless of photoperiod. Diverse 
AP genes have been identified over the past two decades, and most of them 
repress FLC through histone modifications. However, the detailed mechanism 
underlying such modifications remains unclear. Several recent studies have 
revealed novel mechanisms to control FLC repression in concert with histone 
modifications. This review summarizes the latest advances in understanding the 
novel mechanisms by which AP proteins regulate FLC repression, including changes 
in chromatin architecture, RNA polymerase pausing, and liquid-liquid phase 
separation- and ncRNA-mediated gene silencing. Furthermore, we discuss how each 
mechanism is coupled with histone modifications in FLC chromatin.

The assembly of functional biomolecular condensates often involves liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) of proteins with multiple modular domains, which can be 
folded or conformationally disordered to various degrees. To understand the 
LLPS-driving domain-domain interactions, a fundamental question is how readily 
the interactions in the condensed phase can be inferred from interdomain 
interactions in dilute solutions. In particular, are the interactions leading to 
LLPS exclusively those underlying the formation of discrete interdomain 
complexes in homogeneous solutions? We address this question by developing a 
mean-field LLPS theory of two stoichiometrically constrained solute species. The 
theory is applied to the neuronal proteins SynGAP and PSD-95, whose complex 
coacervate serves as a rudimentary model for neuronal postsynaptic densities 
(PSDs). The predicted phase behaviors are compared with experiments. Previously, 
a three SynGAP/two PSD-95 ratio was determined for SynGAP/PSD-95 complexes in 
dilute solutions. However, when this 3:2 stoichiometry is uniformly imposed in 
our theory encompassing both dilute and condensed phases, the tie-line pattern 
of the predicted SynGAP/PSD-95 phase diagram differs drastically from that 
obtained experimentally. In contrast, theories embodying alternate scenarios 
postulating auxiliary SynGAP-PSD-95 as well as SynGAP-SynGAP and PSD-95-PSD-95 
interactions, in addition to those responsible for stoichiometric SynGAP/PSD-95 
complexes, produce tie-line patterns consistent with experiment. Hence, our 
combined theoretical-experimental analysis indicates that weaker interactions or 
higher-order complexes beyond the 3:2 stoichiometry, but not yet documented, are 
involved in the formation of SynGAP/PSD-95 condensates, imploring future efforts 
to ascertain the nature of these auxiliary interactions in PSD-like LLPS and 
underscoring a likely general synergy between stoichiometric, structurally 
specific binding and stochastic, multivalent "fuzzy" interactions in the 
assembly of functional biomolecular condensates.

RB1CC1/FIP200 is an essential macroautophagy/autophagy protein that plays an 
important role in a variety of biological and disease processes through its 
canonical autophagy-dependent and -independent functions. However, it remains 
largely unknown whether post-translational modifications could regulate RB1CC1 
and its associated autophagy functions. Here, we report acetylation of several 
lysine residues of RB1CC1 by acetyltransferase CREBBP (CREB binding protein), 
with K276 as the major CREBBP acetylation site. K276 is also identified as a 
ubiquitination site by mass spectrometry, and acetylation at this site reduces 
ubiquitination of RB1CC1 to inhibit its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We also 
find that RB1CC1 contains an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) 
capable of forming liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, which may 
drive formation of RB1CC1 puncta with LLPS properties in cells independent of 
SQSTM1/p62 and other autophagy receptors CALCOCO2/NDP52, NBR1, TAX1BP1 and OPTN. 
Mutational analysis shows that both K276 acetylation and the N-terminal IDR 
containing it are important for maintaining canonical autophagy function of 
RB1CC1 in breast cancer cells. Our findings demonstrate regulation of RB1CC1 by 
a new post-translational mechanism and suggest potential therapeutic application 
of inducing RB1CC1 degradation through blocking K276 acetylation in the 
treatment of cancer and other diseases.Abbreviations: Baf-A1: bafilomycin A1;

Aquatic autotrophs that fix carbon using ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate 
carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) frequently expend metabolic energy to pump 
inorganic carbon towards the enzyme's active site. A central requirement of this 
strategy is the formation of highly concentrated Rubisco condensates known as 
carboxysomes and pyrenoids, which have convergently evolved multiple times in 
prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively. Recent data indicates these condensates 
form by the mechanism of liquid- liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS requires 
networks of weak multivalent interactions typically mediated by intrinsically 
disordered scaffold proteins. Here we comparatively review recent rapid 
developments that detail the determinants and precise interactions that underlie 
diverse Rubisco condensates. The burgeoning field of biomolecular condensates 
has few examples where LLPS can be linked to clear phenotypic outcomes. When 
present, Rubisco condensates are essential for photosynthesis and growth, and 
they are thus emerging as powerful and tractable models to investigate the 
structure function relationship of phase separation in biology.

Molecular orientation plays a pivotal role in defining the functionality and 
chemistry of interfaces, yet accurate measurements probing this important 
feature are few, due, in part, to technical and analytical limitations in 
extracting information from molecular monolayers. For example, buried 
liquid/liquid interfaces, where a complex and poorly understood balance of 
inter- and intramolecular interactions impart structural constraints that 
facilitate the formation of supramolecular assemblies capable of new functions, 
are difficult to probe experimentally. Here, we use vibrational sum-frequency 
generation spectroscopy, numerical polarization analysis, and atomistic 
molecular dynamics simulations to probe molecular orientations at buried 
oil/aqueous interfaces decorated with amphiphilic oligomers. We show that the 
orientation of self-assembled oligomers changes upon the addition of salts in 
the aqueous phase. The evolution of these structures can be described by 
competitive ion effects in the aqueous phase altering the orientations of the 
tails extending into the oil phase. These specific anionic effects occur via 
interfacial ion pairing and associated changes in interfacial solvation and 
hydrogen-bonding networks. These findings provide more quantitative insight into 
orientational changes encountered during self-assembly and pave the way for the 
design of functional interfaces for chemical separations, neuromorphic computing 
applications, and related biomimetic systems.

The androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer. Development 
of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) requires androgen-independent 
activation of AR, which involves its large N-terminal domain (NTD) and entails 
extensive epigenetic changes depending in part on histone lysine demethylases 
(KDMs) that interact with AR. The AR-NTD is rich in low-complexity sequences, 
including a polyQ repeat. Longer polyQ sequences were reported to decrease 
transcriptional activity and to protect against prostate cancer, although they 
can lead to muscular atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these 
observations are unclear. Using NMR spectroscopy, here we identify weak 
interactions between the AR-NTD and the KDM4A catalytic domain, and between the 
AR ligand-binding domain and a central KDM4A region that also contains 
low-complexity sequences. We also show that the AR-NTD can undergo liquid-liquid 
phase separation in vitro, with longer polyQ sequences phase separating more 
readily. Moreover, longer polyQ sequences hinder nuclear localization in the 
absence of hormone and increase the propensity for formation of AR-containing 
puncta in the nucleus of cells treated with dihydrotestosterone. These results 
lead us to hypothesize that polyQ-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation may 
provide a mechanism to decrease the transcriptional activity of AR, potentially 
opening new opportunities to design effective therapies against CRPC and 
muscular atrophy.

Membrane technology with advantages such as reduced energy consumption due to no 
phase change, low volume and high mass transfer, high separation efficiency for 
solution solutions, straightforward design of membranes, and ease of use on 
industrial scales are different from other separation methods. There are various 
methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, adsorption, precipitation, and 
membrane processes to separate contaminants from an aqueous solution. The liquid 
membrane technique provides a practical and straightforward separation method 
for metal ions as an advanced solvent extraction technique. Stabilized liquid 
membranes require less solvent consumption, lower cost, and more effortless mass 
transfer due to their thinner thickness than other liquid membrane techniques. 
The influence of the electrostatic properties, derived from the electrical 
field, on the ionic transport rate and extraction recovery, in flat sheet 
supported liquid membrane (FSLM) and electro flat sheet supported liquid 
membrane (EFSLM) were numerically investigated. Both FSLM and EFSLM modes of 
operation, in terms of implementing electrostatic, were considered. Through 
adopting a numerical approach, Poisson-Nernst-Planck, and Navier-Stokes 
equations were solved at unsteady-state conditions by considering different 
values of permittivity, diffusivity, and viscosity for the presence of 
electrical force and stirrer, respectively. The most important result of this 
study is that under similar conditions, by increasing the applied voltage, the 
extraction recovery increased. For instance, at EFSLM mode, by increasing the 
applied voltage from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text], the extraction 
recovery increased from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, 
it was also observed that the presence of nanoparticles has significant effects 
on the performance of the SLM system.

Although it is now recognized that specific RNAs and protein families are 
critical for the biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates, how these 
molecular constituents determine condensate size and morphology is unknown. To 
circumvent the biochemical complexity of endogenous RNP condensates, the use of 
programmable tools to reconstitute condensate formation with minimal 
constituents can be instrumental. Here we report a methodology to form 
RNA-containing condensates in living cells programmed to specifically recruit a 
single RNA species. Our bioengineered condensates are made of ArtiGranule 
scaffolds composed of an orthogonal protein that can bind to a specific 
heterologously expressed RNA. These scaffolds undergo liquid-liquid phase 
separation in cells and can be chemically controlled to prevent condensation or 
to trigger condensate dissolution. We found that the targeted RNAs localize at 
the condensate surface, either as isolated RNA molecules or as a homogenous 
corona of RNA molecules around the condensate. The recruitment of RNA changes 
the material properties of condensates by hardening the condensate body. 
Moreover, the condensate size scales with RNA surface density; the higher the 
RNA density is, the smaller and more frequent the condensates are. These results 
suggest a mechanism based on physical constraints, provided by RNAs at the 
condensate surface, that limit condensate growth and coalescence.

Machine learning methods are used for an automated classification of 
experimental two-time X-ray photon correlation maps from an arrested 
liquid-liquid phase separation of a protein solution. The correlation maps are 
matched with correlation maps generated with Cahn-Hilliard-type simulations of 
liquid-liquid phase separations according to two simulation parameters and in 
the last step interpreted in the framework of the simulation. The matching 
routine employs an auto-encoder network and a differential evolution based 
algorithm. The method presented here is a first step towards handling large 
amounts of dynamic data measured at high-brilliance synchrotron and X-ray 
free-electron laser sources, facilitating fast comparison with phase field 
models of phase separation.

Insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells is regulated by cortical complexes that 
are enriched at the sites of adhesion to extracellular matrix facing the 
vasculature. Many components of these complexes, including bassoon, RIM, ELKS 
and liprins, are shared with neuronal synapses. Here, we show that insulin 
secretion sites also contain the non-neuronal proteins LL5β (also known as 
PHLDB2) and KANK1, which, in migrating cells, organize exocytotic machinery in 
the vicinity of integrin-based adhesions. Depletion of LL5β or focal adhesion 
disassembly triggered by myosin II inhibition perturbed the clustering of 
secretory complexes and attenuated the first wave of insulin release. Although 
previous analyses in vitro and in neurons have suggested that secretory 
machinery might assemble through liquid-liquid phase separation, analysis of 
endogenously labeled ELKS in pancreatic islets indicated that its dynamics is 
inconsistent with such a scenario. Instead, fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching and single-molecule imaging showed that ELKS turnover is driven 
by binding and unbinding to low-mobility scaffolds. Both the scaffold movements 
and ELKS exchange were stimulated by glucose treatment. Our findings help to 
explain how integrin-based adhesions control spatial organization of 
glucose-stimulated insulin release.

HYPOTHESIS: For conventional high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) with an 
external osmotic pressure greater than Laplace pressure, once the osmotic 
balance is broken, the swelling or shrinking of the aqueous phase can easily 
trigger phase separation. Mixing two immiscible dispersed phases in a double 
HIPE can evolve differently following an osmotic shock, which is expected to 
create a synergistic effect that can frustrate the phase separation of the 
system.
EXPERIMENTS: Osmotic responses of double HIPEs were studied at the surface of a 
NaCl solution at a range of molarities. Fluorescence confocal microscopy studies 
were carried out to track the responses on microscopic scales. Measurements on 
surface tensions revealed the interfacial behaviors of the used surfactant.
FINDINGS: A synergistic effect is achieved by a symbiotic process between the 
dispersed oils, where one type of droplets become more stable and pack around 
the other ones to halt their coalescence. The essential drive comes from the 
adsorption/desorption of surfactant molecules at oil-water interfaces. By 
directly adjusting the osmotic pressure difference, transitions between osmotic 
down-shock and osmotic up-shock can also be realized. This symbiosis greatly 
expands the potential technological applications of multiple-liquid systems, and 
can be used to design novel multi-functional composite materials.

Fluorescence microscopy assays enable the investigation of endogenous 
biomolecular condensates directly in their cellular context. With appropriate 
experimental designs, these assays yield quantitative information on condensate 
material properties and inform on biophysical mechanisms of condensate 
formation. Single-molecule super-resolution and tracking experiments grant 
access to the smallest condensates and early condensation stages not resolved by 
conventional imaging approaches. Here, we discuss considerations for using 
single-molecule assays to extract quantitative information about biomolecular 
condensates directly in their cellular context.

Rice is a major dietary staple in many communities owing to its high nutritional 
value and characteristic aroma. Oryzanol, a mixture of ferulic acid esters of 
triterpene alcohols and phytosterols, is a major group of phytochemicals found 
in rice. 24-Methylenecycloartanyl ferulate (24MCA-FA), cycloartenyl ferulate 
(CA-FA), and campestanyl ferulate (Camp-FA) have been identified as the primary 
components of oryzanol. At present, for the quantification of oryzanol in rice 
and rice products, UV spectroscopy or high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) is widely employed. However, these methods cannot differentiate 
individual oryzanols, resulting in higher measured values. To extract oryzanol, 
methods including liquid-liquid extraction, acidulation extraction, and direct 
solvent extraction have been typically employed, as they do not require specific 
extraction instrumentation. However, there has been no systematic study on the 
direct solvent extraction and purification conditions of oryzanol in rice. In 
this study, a rapid and accurate analytical method based on HPLC-MS/MS and 
mixed-mode anion exchange (MAX) solid-phase extraction was established to 
determine the content of three oryzanols (24MCA-FA, CA-FA, and Camp-FA) in rice. 
The MS parameters, such as the collision energy of three ion pairs of each 
oryzanol, were optimized. Further, the chromatographic separation conditions and 
response intensities of the oryzanols in different mobile phases were compared. 
The effects of different pretreatment conditions on the extraction efficiency of 
the three oryzanols in rice samples and different purification conditions on 
their recovery were investigated. Combined with the external standard method, 
the three oryzanols in rice were successfully quantified. The results showed 
that the baseline separation and highest response for the three oryzanols were 
achieved using the Agilent Eclipse XDB-C8 chromatographic column (150 mm×2.1 mm, 
3.5 μm) when methanol∶ acetonitrile in a 1∶1 ratio (v/v) and an aqueous solution 
of 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate were used as the mobile phases for gradient 
elution. The extraction rate of the three oryzanols was highest when using 2.5 g 
of the sample, adding 20 mL of methanol, soaking for 12 h, ultrasonicating at a 
temperature of 40 ℃ for 20 min, and centrifuging the extracted solutions at 4500 
r/min for 10 min. The samples were purified by MAX, and the sample matrix effect 
was found to be lesser than 1.6%-10.8%. Under the optimum conditions, the 
calibration curves of the three oryzanols showed good linearity (correlation 
coefficients r2≥0.9983) within their respective linear ranges. The limits of 
detection were in the range of 0.5-1.0 μg/L, and limits of quantification were 
in the range of 2.0-3.5 μg/L. Accuracy and precision experiments were performed 
on rice samples spiked at three levels (2, 5, and 10 times the background 
concentration), with three replicates. The average recoveries of the three 
oryzanols ranged from 86.1% to 110.6%, and the relative standard deviations 
(RSDs) were between 0.9% and 3.2%. The method showed good performance when 
applied to the analysis of real samples. In conclusion, the developed method can 
determine the content of the three oryzanols in rice quickly and accurately, and 
can be used for the subsequent measurement of oryzanol compounds in rice.

Androgen receptor (AR) is a key member of nuclear hormone receptors with the 
longest intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) in its protein family. 
There are four mono-amino acid repeats (polyQ1, polyQ2, polyG, and polyP) 
located within its NTD, of which two are polymorphic (polyQ1 and polyG). The 
length of both polymorphic repeats shows clinically important correlations with 
disease, especially with cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, as shorter and 
longer alleles exhibit significant differences in expression, activity and 
solubility. Importantly, AR has also been shown to undergo condensation in the 
nucleus by liquid-liquid phase separation, a process highly sensitive to protein 
solubility and concentration. Nonetheless, in prostate cancer cells, AR variants 
also partition into transcriptional condensates, which have been shown to alter 
the expression of target gene products. In this review, we summarize current 
knowledge on the link between AR repeat polymorphisms and cancer types, 
including mechanistic explanations and models comprising the relationship 
between condensate formation, polyQ1 length and transcriptional activity. 
Moreover, we outline the evolutionary paths of these recently evolved amino acid 
repeats across mammalian species, and discuss new research directions with 
potential breakthroughs and controversies in the literature.

A mini-review on bio-inspired polymer self-assembly: single-component and

Biology demonstrates meticulous ways to control biomaterials self-assemble into 
ordered and disordered structures to carry out necessary bioprocesses. 
Empowering the synthetic polymers to self-assemble like biomaterials is a 
hallmark of polymer physics studies. Unlike protein engineering, polymer science 
demystifies self-assembly by purposely embedding particular functional groups 
into the backbone of the polymer while isolating others. The polymer field has 
now entered an era of advancing materials design by mimicking nature to a very 
large extend. For example, we can make sequence-specific polymers to study 
highly ordered mesostructures similar to studying proteins, and use charged 
polymers to study liquid-liquid phase separation as in membraneless organelles. 
This mini-review summarizes recent advances in studying self-assembly using 
bio-inspired strategies on single-component and multi-component systems. 
Sequence-defined techniques are used to make on-demand hybrid materials to 
isolate the effects of chirality and chemistry in synthetic block copolymer 
self-assembly. In the meantime, sequence patterning leads to more hierarchical 
assemblies comprised of only hydrophobic and hydrophilic comonomers. The second 
half of the review discusses complex coacervates formed as a result of the 
associative charge interactions of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. The 
tunable phase behavior and viscoelasticity are unique in studying liquid 
macrophase separation because the slow polymer relaxation comes primarily from 
charge interactions. Studies of bio-inspired polymer self-assembly significantly 
impact how we optimize user-defined materials on a molecular level.

Increasing evidence indicates that cells can regulate biochemical functions in 
time and space by generating membraneless compartments with well-defined 
mesoscopic properties. One important mechanism underlying this control is simple 
coacervation driven by associative disordered proteins that encode multivalent 
interactions. Inspired by these observations, programmable droplets based on 
simple coacervation of responsive synthetic polymers that mimic the 
"stickers-and-spacers" architecture of biological disordered proteins are 
developed. Zwitterionic polymers that undergo an enthalpy-driven liquid-liquid 
phase separation process and form liquid droplets that remarkably exclude most 
molecules are developed. Starting from this reference material, different 
functional groups in the zwitterionic polymer are progressively added to encode 
an increasing number of different intermolecular interactions. This strategy 
allowed the multiple emerging properties of the droplets to be controlled 
independently, such as stimulus-responsiveness, polarity, selective uptake of 
client molecules, fusion times, and miscibility. By exploiting this high 
programmability, a model of cellular compartmentalization is reproduced and 
droplets capable of confining different molecules in space without physical 
barriers are generated. Moreover, these biomolecular sorters are demonstrated to 
be able to localize, separate, and enable the detection of target molecules even 
within complex mixtures, opening attractive applications in bioseparation, and 
diagnostics.

The retrovirus HIV-1 integrates into the host genome and establishes a latent 
viral reservoir that escapes immune surveillance. Molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 
latency have been studied extensively to achieve a cure for the acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Latency-reversing agents (LRAs) have been 
developed to reactivate and eliminate the latent reservoir by the immune system. 
To develop more promising LRAs, it is essential to evaluate new therapeutic 
targets. Here, we find that CBX4, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 
1 (PRC1), contributes to HIV-1 latency in seven latency models and primary CD4+ 
T cells. CBX4 forms nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
properties on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and recruits EZH2, the 
catalytic subunit of PRC2. CBX4 SUMOylates EZH2 utilizing its SUMO E3 ligase 
activity, thereby enhancing the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of EZH2. Our 
results indicate that CBX4 acts as a bridge between the repressor complexes PRC1 
and PRC2 that act synergistically to maintain HIV-1 latency. Dissolution of 
phase-separated CBX4 bodies could be a potential intervention to reactivate 
latent HIV-1.

The relationship between dehydration of polymer chains and the nanodroplet 
formation through the macroscopic liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has been 
investigated for the aqueous solution of stereocontrolled 
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAm) and poly(N-diethylacrylamide) (PNdEAm). The 
fluorescent probe method reveals that the temperature range of dehydration for 
PNiPAm chains is much narrower than that for PNdEAm. The sharp dehydration of 
polymer chains may give rise to the characteristic thermoresponsive behavior of 
PNiPAm in water. For meso-rich PNiPAms, the dehydration point (Tdh), which is 
defined as the temperature where the single chains start assembling in the 
solution, locates far from the cloud point (Tc). That is, the dehydration of the 
chain occurs antecedently before the system undergoes a macroscopic LLPS. For 
PNdEAm, however, the dissociation between Tdh and Tc is not found. For the 
aqueous solution of PNiPAm with 52% of the meso content, the fluorescence 
correlation spectroscopy has revealed that nano-order droplets (ca. 45 nm of the 
hydration radius) are stabilized in the intermediate state between Tdh and Tc. 
The sharp dehydration of PNiPAm chains may enable an acute condensation of 
polymers in droplets, causing a viscoelastic hindrance in the coalescence of 
droplets.

Liquid-liquid phase separation of protein and RNA complexes into biomolecular 
condensates has emerged as a ubiquitous phenomenon in living systems. These 
protein-RNA condensates are thought to be involved in many biological functions 
in all forms of life. One of the most sought-after properties of these 
condensates is their dynamical properties, as they are a major determinant of 
condensate physiological function and disease processes. Measurement of the 
diffusion dynamics of individual components in a multicomponent biomolecular 
condensate is therefore routinely performed. Here, we outline the experimental 
procedure for performing in-droplet fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 
measurements to extract the diffusion coefficient of individual molecules within 
a biomolecular condensate in vitro. Unlike more common experiments such as 
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), where data interpretation is 
not straightforward and strictly model dependent, FCS offers a robust and more 
accurate way to quantify biomolecular diffusion rates in the dense phase. The 
small observation volume allows FCS experiments to report on the local diffusion 
coefficient within a spatial resolution of <1 μm, making it ideal for probing 
spatial inhomogeneities within condensates as well as variable dynamics within 
subcompartments of multiphasic condensates.

A simple, rapid, and efficient pretreatment method of mefentrifluconazole 
enantiomers in cereal samples was established by dispersive liquid-liquid 
microextraction coupled with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode 
array detector (UHPLC-DAD). In this study, a novel ternary magnetic deep 
eutectic solvent (MDES) [octyltrimethylammonium bromide][cobalt chloride][acetic 
acid] was synthesized as the extractant. Acetic acid was used as the dispersant 
to promote the in situ dispersion of binary MDES [octyltrimethylammonium 
bromide][cobalt chloride]. The microdroplets of binary MDES containing 
mefentrifluconazole were separated by an external magnet. Device-assisted 
dispersion and time-consuming centrifugation steps were eliminated to ensure 
simplicity and rapidity of the pretreatment. Good linearity ranging from 
0.01 μg g-1 to 2 μg g-1 was obtained. The extraction recovery varied from 82.9 
to 95.0%. The limit of detection was 0.003 μg g-1. Finally, this established 
approach has been applied for the enantioselective detection of chiral 
mefentrifluconazole in corn, rice, wheat, millet, and sorghum samples.

Membraneless organelles are cellular compartments that form by liquid-liquid 
phase separation of one or more components. Other molecules, such as proteins 
and nucleic acids, will distribute between the cytoplasm and the liquid 
compartment in accordance with the thermodynamic drive to lower the free energy 
of the system. The resulting distribution colocalizes molecular species to carry 
out a diversity of functions. Two factors could drive this partitioning: the 
difference in solvation between the dilute versus dense phase and intermolecular 
interactions between the client and scaffold proteins. Here, we develop a set of 
knowledge-based potentials that allow for the direct comparison between 
stickiness, which is dominated by desolvation energy, and pairwise residue 
contact propensity terms. We use these scales to examine experimental data from 
two systems: protein cargo dissolving within phase-separated droplets made from 
FG repeat proteins of the nuclear pore complex and client proteins dissolving 
within phase-separated FUS droplets. These analyses reveal a close agreement 
between the stickiness of the client proteins and the experimentally determined 
values of the partition coefficients (R > 0.9), while pairwise residue contact 
propensities between client and scaffold show weaker correlations. Hence, the 
stickiness of client proteins is sufficient to explain their differential 
partitioning within these two phase-separated systems without taking into 
account the composition of the condensate. This result implies that selective 
trafficking of client proteins to distinct membraneless organelles requires 
recognition elements beyond the client sequence composition. STATEMENT: 
Empirical potentials for amino acid stickiness and pairwise residue contact 
propensities are derived. These scales are unique in that they enable direct 
comparison of desolvation versus contact terms. We find that partitioning of a 
client protein to a condensate is best explained by amino acid stickiness.

Aminopeptidase I (Ape1) is one of the major cargoes of the cytoplasm-to-vacuole 
targeting (Cvt) pathway, which is a kind of selective autophagy, in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After synthesis, the Ape1 precursor (prApe1) undergoes 
phase separation to form liquid droplets, termed Ape1 droplets, in the 
cytoplasm. In this study, we found that cells expressing prApe1-GFP exhibited 
temperature-sensitive formation of Ape1 droplets, which affected its transport. 
Moreover, we showed that endogenous Ape1 transport was defective at high 
temperatures in various laboratory strains due to the defect in the formation of 
Ape1 droplets at these temperatures. Finally, we found that gene disruptants 
showing heat-tolerant growth suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the Ape1 
transport. The formation of Ape1 droplets might be an indicator of cytoplasmic 
integrity at high temperature.

MERS-CoV infection can damage the cellular metabolic processes, but the 
underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Through screening, we found 
non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of MERS-CoV could inhibit cell viability, cell 
cycle, and cell migration through its endonuclease activity. Transcriptome 
sequencing revealed that MERS-CoV nsp1 specifically downregulated the mRNAs of 
ribosomal protein genes, oxidative phosphorylation protein genes, and antigen 
presentation genes, but upregulated the mRNAs of transcriptional regulatory 
genes. Further analysis shown nsp1 existed in a novel ribonucleosome complex 
formed via liquid-liquid phase separation, which did not co-localize with 
mitochondria, lysosomes, P-bodies, or stress granules. Interestingly, the 
nsp1-located granules specifically contained mRNAs of ribosomal protein genes 
and oxidative phosphorylation genes, which may explain why MERS-CoV nsp1 
selectively degraded these mRNAs in cells. Finally, MERS-CoV nsp1 transgenic 
mice showed significant loss of body weight and an increased sensitivity to 
poly(I:C)-induced inflammatory death. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism 
by which MERS-CoV impairs cell viability, which serves as a potential novel 
target for preventing MERS-CoV infection-induced pathological 
damage.Abbreviations: (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),

Biomolecular condensates, physically underpinned to a significant extent by 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), are now widely recognized by numerous 
experimental studies to be of fundamental biological, biomedical, and 
biophysical importance. In the face of experimental discoveries, analytical 
formulations emerged as a powerful yet tractable tool in recent theoretical 
investigations of the role of LLPS in the assembly and dissociation of these 
condensates. The pertinent LLPS often involves, though not exclusively, 
intrinsically disordered proteins engaging in multivalent interactions that are 
governed by their amino acid sequences. For researchers interested in applying 
these theoretical methods, here we provide a practical guide to a set of 
computational techniques devised for extracting sequence-dependent LLPS 
properties from analytical formulations. The numerical procedures covered 
include those for the determination of spinodal and binodal phase boundaries 
from a general free energy function with examples based on the random phase 
approximation in polymer theory, construction of tie lines for 
multiple-component LLPS, and field-theoretic simulation of multiple-chain 
heteropolymeric systems using complex Langevin dynamics. Since a more accurate 
physical picture often requires comparing analytical theory against 
explicit-chain model predictions, a commonly utilized methodology for 
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of sequence-specific LLPS is also 
briefly outlined.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a common phenomenon underlying the 
formation of dynamic membraneless organelles in biological cells, which are 
emerging as major players in controlling cellular functions and health. The 
bottom-up synthesis of biomolecular liquid systems with simple constituents, 
like nucleic acids and peptides, is useful to understand LLPS in nature as well 
as to develop programmable means to build new amorphous materials with 
properties matching or surpassing those observed in natural condensates. In 
particular, understanding which parameters determine condensate growth kinetics 
is essential for the synthesis of condensates with the capacity for active, 
dynamic behaviors. Here we use DNA nanotechnology to study artificial liquid 
condensates through programmable star-shaped subunits, focusing on the effects 
of changing subunit size. First, we show that LLPS is achieved in a 6-fold range 
of subunit size. Second, we demonstrate that the rate of growth of condensate 
droplets scales with subunit size. Our investigation is supported by a general 
model that describes how coarsening and coalescence are expected to scale with 
subunit size under ideal assumptions. Beyond suggesting a route toward achieving 
control of LLPS kinetics via design of subunit size in synthetic liquids, our 
work suggests that particle size may be a key parameter in biological 
condensation processes.

A novel water-based deep eutectic solvent was synthesized and used for the 
ultrasound-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction of parabens in edible oil and 
for their determination by high performance liquid chromatography. Herein, the 
water-based deep eutectic solvent was formulated at room temperature by 
tetrabutylammonium chloride as hydrogen bond acceptor and water as hydrogen bond 
donor at the molar ratio of 1:5. As component, water has the effect on tailoring 
the physicochemical properties of water-based deep eutectic solvent and 
assisting tetrabutylammonium chloride (hydrogen bond acceptor) capturing 
parabens (hydrogen bond donor) through in-situ deep eutectic solvent formation. 
The developed method has satisfactory linearity (1.5-500 μg/L), limits of 
detections (0.2-0.4 μg/L), precisions (RSDs ≤ 5.8%), and was fruitfully applied 
to detect parabens in edible oil with excellent recoveries (85.1-106.8%). The 
feature of the procedure lies in simplicity, low cost and high sensitivity, and 
this can be extended for the efficient separation of other hydrophobic 
compounds.

Biomolecular condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a 
crucial role in the spatiotemporal organization of the cell material. Nucleic 
acids can act as critical modulators in the stability of these protein 
condensates. To unveil the role of RNA length in regulating the stability of RNA 
binding protein (RBP) condensates, we present a multiscale computational 
strategy that exploits the advantages of a sequence-dependent coarse-grained 
representation of proteins and a minimal coarse-grained model wherein proteins 
are described as patchy colloids. We find that for a constant nucleotide/protein 
ratio, the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS), which can phase separate on its 
own-i.e., via homotypic interactions-only exhibits a mild dependency on the RNA 
strand length. In contrast, the 25-repeat proline-arginine peptide (PR25), which 
does not undergo LLPS on its own at physiological conditions but instead 
exhibits complex coacervation with RNA-i.e., via heterotypic interactions-shows 
a strong dependence on the length of the RNA strands. Our minimal patchy 
particle simulations suggest that the strikingly different effect of RNA length 
on homotypic LLPS versus RBP-RNA complex coacervation is general. Phase 
separation is RNA-length dependent whenever the relative contribution of 
heterotypic interactions sustaining LLPS is comparable or higher than those 
stemming from protein homotypic interactions. Taken together, our results 
contribute to illuminate the intricate physicochemical mechanisms that influence 
the stability of RBP condensates through RNA inclusion.

Biomineral-forming organisms produce inorganic materials with complex, 
genetically encoded morphologies that are unmatched by current synthetic 
chemistry. It is poorly understood which genes are involved in biomineral 
morphogenesis and how the encoded proteins guide this process. We addressed 
these questions using diatoms, which are paradigms for the self-assembly of 
hierarchically meso- and macroporous silica under mild reaction conditions. 
Proteomics analysis of the intracellular organelle for silica biosynthesis led 
to the identification of new biomineralization proteins. Three of these, coined 
dAnk1-3, contain a common protein-protein interaction domain (ankyrin repeats), 
indicating a role in coordinating assembly of the silica biomineralization 
machinery. Knocking out individual dank genes led to aberrations in silica 
biogenesis that are consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation as underlying 
mechanism for pore pattern morphogenesis. Our work provides an unprecedented 
path for the synthesis of tailored mesoporous silica materials using synthetic 
biology.

Fused in sarcoma (FUS), a DNA/RNA-binding protein, undergoes liquid-liquid phase 
separation to form granules in cells. Aberrant FUS granulation is associated 
with neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We found that FUS granules contain a 
multifunctional AAA ATPase, valosin-containing protein (VCP), which is known as 
a key regulator of protein degradation. FUS granule stability depends on ATP 
concentrations in cells. VCP ATPase changes the FUS granule stability 
time-dependently by consuming ATP to reduce its concentrations in the granules: 
VCPs in de novo FUS granules stabilize the granules, while long-lasting VCP 
colocalization destabilizes the granules. The proteolysis-promoting function of 
VCP may subsequently dissolve the unstabilized granules. We propose that VCP 
colocalized to the FUS granules acts as a timer to limit the residence time of 
the granules in cells.

A sensitive capillary electrophoresis strategy was developed by combining 
salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction and online three-step stacking to 
detect trace quantities of antitumour indole alkaloids in complex biological 
samples. The proposed strategy fully exploits these two technologies such that 
extraction, online stacking and separation are combined in a fast and efficient 
manner. First, salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction was used to extract 
three indole alkaloids (vinblastine sulfate, catharanthine sulfate and 
vindoline) from complex biomasses. An appropriate volume of acetonitrile (ACN) 
was mixed with a faecal aqueous solution to precipitate proteins. The mixed 
solution was vortexed, followed by the addition of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) 
to induce two-phase separation. Alkaloids were effectively extracted into the 
organic phase, which was then subjected to capillary electrophoresis (CE) 
analysis. The sensitivity of capillary electrophoresis was effectively improved 
by online three-step stacking. Good linearity of the calibration curve for each 
indole alkaloid was obtained in the concentration range of 0.1-1 μg/mL. Under 
optimal conditions, the sensitivity of ordinary injection was increased by up to 
2366-fold, confirming the applicability of the proposed strategy for the 
sensitive determination of trace indole alkaloids in complex biological samples.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of transient signaling platforms in the 
plasma membrane has remained a key experimental challenge. Here, biofunctional 
nanodot arrays (bNDAs) are developed to spatially control dimerization and 
clustering of cell surface receptors at the nanoscale. High-contrast bNDAs with 
spot diameters of ≈300 nm are obtained by capillary nanostamping of bovine serum 
albumin bioconjugates, which are subsequently biofunctionalized by reaction with 
tandem anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP) clamp fusions. Spatially controlled 
assembly of active Wnt signalosomes is achieved at the nanoscale in the plasma 
membrane of live cells by capturing the co-receptor Lrp6 into bNDAs via an 
extracellular GFP tag. Strikingly, co-recruitment is observed of co-receptor 
Frizzled-8 as well as the cytosolic scaffold proteins Axin-1 and Disheveled-2 
into Lrp6 nanodots in the absence of ligand. Density variation and the high 
dynamics of effector proteins uncover highly cooperative liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS)-driven assembly of Wnt "signalodroplets" at the plasma 
membrane, pinpointing the synergistic effects of LLPS for Wnt signaling 
amplification. These insights highlight the potential of bNDAs for 
systematically interrogating nanoscale signaling platforms and condensation at 
the plasma membrane of live cells.

Phytochromes are red- and far-red light receptors that control the growth and 
development of plants, enabling them to respond adequately to changing light 
conditions. It has been shown that halted mRNAs stored in RNA granules called 
processing bodies are released upon light perception and contribute to the 
adaptation to the light environment. However, the photophysiological background 
of this process is largely unknown. We found that light of different wavelengths 
can trigger the disassembly of processing bodies in a dose- and time-dependent 
manner. We show that phytochromes control this process in red- and far-red light 
and that cytoplasmic phytochrome A is sufficient and necessary for the far-red 
light-induced disassembly of processing bodies. This adds a novel, unexpected 
cytoplasmic function to the processes controlled by phytochrome A. Overall, our 
findings suggest a role of phytochromes in the control of translationally halted 
mRNAs that are stored in processing bodies. We expect our findings to facilitate 
understanding of how light and environmental cues control the assembly and 
disassembly of processing bodies, which could have broader implications for the 
regulation of non-membranous organelles in general.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence indicates that epigenetic modulation of gene 
expression plays a key role in the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic 
kidney disease (ADPKD). However, the molecular basis for how the altered 
epigenome modulates transcriptional responses, and thereby disease progression 
in ADPKD, remains largely unknown.
METHODS: Kidneys from control and ADPKD mice were examined for the expression of 
CDYL and histone acylations. CDYL expression and its correlation with disease 
severity were analyzed in a cohort of patients with ADPKD. Cdyl transgenic mice 
were crossed with Pkd1 knockout mice to explore CDYL's role in ADPKD 
progression. Integrated cistromic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to 
identify direct CDYL target genes. High-sensitivity mass spectrometry analyses 
were undertaken to characterize CDYL-regulated histone lysine crotonylations 
(Kcr). Biochemical analysis and zebrafish models were used for investigating 
CDYL phase separation.
RESULTS: CDYL was downregulated in ADPKD kidneys, accompanied by an increase of 
histone Kcr. Genetic overexpression of Cdyl reduced histone Kcr and slowed cyst 
growth. We identified CDYL-regulated cyst-associated genes, whose downregulation 
depended on CDYL-mediated suppression of histone Kcr. CDYL assembled nuclear 
condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation in cultured kidney epithelial 
cells and in normal kidney tissues. The phase-separating capacity of CDYL was 
required for efficient suppression of locus-specific histone Kcr, of expression 
of its target genes, and of cyst growth.
CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate a mechanism by which CDYL nuclear 
condensation links histone Kcr to transcriptional responses and cystogenesis in 
ADPKD.

Adsorption of urea from dialysate is essential for wearable artificial kidneys 
(WRK). Molecularly imprinted microspheres with nanoporous and multilayered 
structures are prepared based on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which 
can selectively adsorb urea. In addition, we combine the microspheres with a 
designed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip to propose an efficient urea 
adsorption platform. In this work, we propose a formulation of LLPS including 
Tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA), ethanol, and acrylic acid (30% v/v), to 
prepare urea molecularly imprinted microspheres in a simple and highly 
controllable method. These microspheres have urea molecular imprinting sites on 
the surface and inside, allowing selective adsorption of urea and preservation 
of other essential constituents. Previous static studies on urea adsorption have 
not considered the combination between urea adsorbent and WRK. Therefore, we 
design the platform embedded with urea molecular imprinted microspheres, which 
can disturb the fluid motion and improve the efficiency of urea adsorption. 
These advantages enable the urea absorption platform to be highly promising for 
dialysate regeneration in WRK.

Membrane-less organelles (MLOs) are formed by biomolecular liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS). Proteins with charged low-complexity domains (LCDs) are prone 
to phase separation and localize to MLOs, but the mechanism underlying the 
distributions of such proteins to specific MLOs remains poorly understood. 
Recently, proteins with Arg-enriched mixed-charge domains (R-MCDs), primarily 
composed of R and Asp (D), were found to accumulate in nuclear speckles via 
LLPS. However, the process by which R-MCDs selectively incorporate into nuclear 
speckles is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the patterning of charged amino 
acids and net charge determines the targeting of specific MLOs, including 
nuclear speckles and the nucleolus, by proteins. The redistribution of R and D 
residues from an alternately sequenced pattern to uneven blocky sequences caused 
a shift in R-MCD distribution from nuclear speckles to the nucleolus. In 
addition, the incorporation of basic residues in the R-MCDs promoted their 
localization to the MLOs and their apparent accumulation in the nucleolus. The 
R-MCD peptide with alternating amino acids did not undergo LLPS, whereas the 
blocky R-MCD peptide underwent LLPS with affinity to RNA, acidic poly-Glu, and 
the acidic nucleolar protein nucleophosmin, suggesting that the clustering of R 
residues helps avoid their neutralization by D residues and eventually induces 
R-MCD migration to the nucleolus. Therefore, the distribution of proteins to 
nuclear speckles requires the proximal positioning of D and R for the mutual 
neutralization of their charges.

Chromatin is spatially organized into functional states that are defined by both 
the presence of specific histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and a 
defined set of chromatin-associated "reader" proteins. Different models for the 
underlying mechanism of such compartmentalization have been proposed, including 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of chromatin-associated proteins to drive 
spatial organization. Heterochromatin, characterized by lysine 9 methylation on 
histone H3 (H3K9me3) and the presence of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) as a 
multivalent reader, represents a prime example of a spatially defined chromatin 
state. Heterochromatin foci exhibit features of protein condensates driven by 
LLPS; however, the exact nature of the physicochemical environment within 
heterochromatin in different cell types is not completely understood. Here we 
present tools to interrogate the environment of chromatin subcompartments in the 
form of modular, cell-permeable, multivalent, and fluorescent peptide probes. 
These probes can be tuned to target specific chromatin states by providing 
binding sites to reader proteins and can thereby integrate into the PTM-reader 
interaction network. Here we generate probes specific to HP1, directing them to 
heterochromatin at chromocenters in mouse fibroblasts. Moreover, we use a 
polarity-sensing photoactivatable probe that photoconverts to a fluorescent 
state in phase-separated protein droplets and thereby reports on the local 
microenvironment. Equipped with this dye, our probes indeed turn fluorescent in 
murine chromocenters. Image analysis and single-molecule tracking experiments 
reveal that the compartments are less dense and more dynamic than HP1 
condensates obtained in vitro. Our results thus demonstrate that the local 
organization of heterochromatin in chromocenters is internally more complex than 
an HP1 condensate.

Liquid-liquid extraction is a commonly used technique to separate metals and is 
a process that has particular relevance to the nuclear industry. There has been 
a drive to use environmentally friendly ligands composed only of carbon, 
hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. One example is the i-SANEX process that has been 
developed to separate minor actinides from spent nuclear fuel. The underlying 
science of such processes, is, however, both complex and intriguing. Recent 
research indicates that the liquid phases involved are frequently structured 
fluids with a hierarchical organization of aggregates. Effective flow-sheet 
modeling of such processes is likely to benefit from the knowledge of the 
fundamental properties of these phases. As a stepping stone toward this, we have 
performed molecular dynamics simulations on a metal free i-SANEX system composed 
of the ligand N,N,N',N'-tetraoctyl diglycolamide (TODGA), diluent hydrogenated 
tetrapropylene (TPH), and polar species water and nitric acid. We have also 
studied the effects of adding n-octanol and swapping TPH for n-dodecane. It 
would seem sensible to understand this simpler system before introducing metal 
complexes. Such an understanding would ideally arise from studying the system's 
properties over a wide range of compositions. The large number of components, 
however, precludes a comprehensive scan of compositions, so we have chosen to 
study a fixed concentration of TODGA while varying the concentrations of water 
and nitric acid over a substantial range. Reverse aggregates are observed, with 
polar species in the interior in contact with the polar portions of the TODGA 
molecules and the organic diluent on the exterior in contact with the TODGA 
alkyl chains. These aggregates are irregular in shape and grow in size as the 
amount of water and nitric acid increases. At a sufficiently high polar content, 
a single extended cluster forms corresponding to the third phase formation. No 
well-defined bonding motifs were observed between the polar species and TODGA. 
The cluster size distribution fits an isodesmic model, where the Gibbs energy 
change of adding a TODGA molecule to a cluster ranges between 4.5 and 7.0 kJ 
mol-1, depending on the system composition. The addition of n-octanol was found 
to reduce the degree of aggregation, with n-octanol acting as a co-surfactant. 
Exchanging the diluent TPH for n-dodecane also decreased the aggregation. We 
present evidence that this is due to the greater penetration of n-dodecane into 
the reverse aggregates. It is known, however, that the propensity for the third 
phase formation is greater with n-dodecane as the diluent than is the case with 
TPH, but we argue that these two results are not contradictory. This research 
casts light on the driving forces for aggregation, informs process engineers as 
to what species are present, and indicates that flow-sheet liquid-liquid 
extraction modeling might benefit by incorporating an isodesmic aggregation 
approach.

Thermal stiffening materials that are naturally soft but adaptively 
self-strengthen upon heat are intriguing for load-bearing and self-protection 
applications at elevated temperatures. However, to simultaneously achieve high 
modulus change amplitude and high mechanical strength at the stiffened state 
remains challenging. Herein, entropy-mediated polymer-mineral cluster 
interactions are exploited to afford thermal stiffening hydrogels with a 
record-high storage modulus enhancement of 13 000 times covering a super wide 
regime from 1.3 kPa to 17 MPa. Such a dramatic thermal stiffening effect is 
ascribed to the transition from liquid-liquid to solid-liquid phase separations, 
and at the molecular level, driven by enhanced polymer-cluster interactions. The 
hydrogel is further processed into sheath-core fibers and smart fabrics, which 
demonstrate self-strengthening and self-powered sensing properties by co-weaving 
another liquid metal fiber as both the joule heater and triboelectric layer.

We investigate the microscopic pathway of spontaneous crystallization in the ST2 
model of water under deeply supercooled conditions via unbiased classical 
molecular dynamics simulations. After quenching below the liquid-liquid critical 
point, the ST2 model spontaneously separates into low-density liquid (LDL) and 
high-density liquid phases, respectively. The LDL phase, which is characterized 
by lower molecular mobility and enhanced structural order, fosters the formation 
of a sub-critical ice nucleus that, after a stabilization time, develops into 
the critical nucleus and grows. Polymorphic selection coincides with the 
development of the sub-critical nucleus and favors the formation of cubic (Ic) 
over hexagonal (Ih) ice. We rationalize polymorphic selection in terms of 
geometric arguments based on differences in the symmetry of second neighbor 
shells of ice Ic and Ih, which are posited to favor formation of the former. The 
rapidly growing critical nucleus absorbs both Ic and Ih crystallites dispersed 
in the liquid phase, a crystal with stacking faults. Our results are consistent 
with, and expand upon, recent observations of non-classical nucleation pathways 
in several systems.

Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) have different steroid profiles in serum, 
depending on the causative genetic mutation. Ion mobility is a separation 
technique for gas-phase ions based on their m/z values, shapes, and sizes. Human 
serum (100 µL) was purified by liquid-liquid extraction using tert-butyl methyl 
ether/ethyl acetate at 1/1 (v/v) and mixed with deuterium-labeled steroids as 
the internal standard. The separated supernatant was dried, re-dissolved in 
water containing 20% methanol, and injected into a liquid chromatography-ion 
mobility-mass spectrometer (LC/IM/MS). We established a highly sensitive assay 
system by separating 20 steroids based on their retention time, m/z value, and 
drift time. Twenty steroids were measured in the serum of patients with primary 
aldosteronism, essential hypertension, and healthy subjects and were clearly 
classified using principal component analysis. This method was also able to 
detect phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, which were not 
targeted. LC/IM/MS has a high selectivity for known compounds and has the 
potential to provide information on unknown compounds. This analytical method 
has the potential to elucidate the pathogenesis of APA and identify unknown 
steroids that could serve as biomarkers for APA with different genetic 
mutations.

Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are widespread in bacteria and are used for a 
variety of metabolic purposes, including catabolism of host metabolites. A suite 
of proteins self-assembles into the shell and cargo layers of BMCs. However, the 
native assembly state of these large complexes remains to be elucidated. Herein, 
chemical probes were used to observe structural features of a native BMC. While 
the exterior could be demarcated with fluorophores, the interior was 
unexpectedly permeable, suggesting that the shell layer may be more dynamic than 
previously thought. This allowed access to cross-linking chemical probes, which 
were analyzed to uncover the protein interactome. These cross-links revealed a 
complex multivalent network among cargo proteins that contained encapsulation 
peptides and demonstrated that the shell layer follows discrete rules in its 
assembly. These results are consistent overall with a model in which 
biomolecular condensation drives interactions of cargo proteins before 
envelopment by shell layer proteins.

Condensation, or liquid-like phase separation, is a phenomenon indispensable for 
the spatiotemporal regulation of molecules within the cell. Recent studies 
indicate that the composition and molecular organization of phase-separated 
organelles such as Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (PBs) are highly 
variable and dynamic. A dense contact network involving both RNAs and proteins 
controls the formation of SGs and PBs and an intricate molecular architecture, 
at present poorly understood, guarantees that these assemblies sense and adapt 
to different stresses and environmental changes. Here, we investigated the 
physico-chemical properties of SGs and PBs components and studied the 
architecture of their interaction networks. We found that proteins and RNAs 
establishing the largest amount of contacts in SGs and PBs have distinct 
properties and intrinsic disorder is enriched in all protein-RNA, 
protein-protein and RNA-RNA interaction networks. The increase of disorder in 
proteins is accompanied by an enrichment in single-stranded regions of RNA 
binding partners. Our results suggest that SGs and PBs quickly assemble and 
disassemble through dynamic contacts modulated by unfolded domains of their 
components.

Mitigation of biofouling and the host's foreign body response (FBR) is a 
critical challenge with biomedical implants. The surface coating with various 
anti-fouling materials provides a solution to overcome it, but limited options 
in clinic and their potential immunogenicity drive the development of more 
alternative coating materials. Herein, inspired by liquid-liquid phase 
separation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to form separated 
condensates in physiological conditions, we develop a new type of low-fouling 
biomaterial based on flexible IDP of FUS protein containing rich hydrophilic 
residues. A chemical structure-defined FUS IDP sequence tagged with a 
tetra-cysteine motif (IDPFUS) was engineered and applied for covalent 
immobilization on various surfaces to form a uniform layer of protein tangles, 
which boosted strong hydration on surfaces, as revealed by molecular dynamics 
simulation. The IDPFUS-coated surfaces displayed excellent performance in 
resisting adsorption of various proteins and adhesion of different cells, 
platelets, and bacteria. Moreover, the IDPFUS-coated implants largely mitigated 
the host's FBR compared with bare implants and particularly outperformed 
PEG-coated implants in reducing collagen encapsulation. Thus, this novel 
low-fouling and anti-FBR strategy provides a potential surface coating material 
for biomedical implants, which will also shed light on exploring similar 
applications of other IDP proteins.

The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcriptional regulators that 
orchestrate multiple vital processes such as inflammation, metabolism, and cell 
proliferation. In recent years, it has become clear that some nuclear receptors 
form condensates in living cells. These condensates contain high concentrations 
of proteins and can contain millions of molecules. At these sites, high 
concentrations of nuclear receptors and co-factors potentially contribute to 
efficient transcription. While condensate formation has been observed for some 
nuclear receptors, the majority have unknown condensate formation abilities. 
Condensate formation abilities for these NRs would implicate an additional layer 
of regulation for the entire nuclear receptor family. Here, we consider the 
nuclear receptor superfamily, the current evidence for condensate formation of 
some of its members and the potential of the whole superfamily to form 
condensates. Insights into the regulation of assembly or disassembly of nuclear 
receptor condensates and our considerations for the understudied family members 
imply that condensate biology might be an important aspect of nuclear 
receptor-regulated gene transcription.

Measles, Nipah and Hendra viruses are severe human pathogens within the 
Paramyxoviridae family. Their non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA 
genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid 
that is the substrate used by the viral RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RpRd) for 
transcription and replication. The RpRd is a complex made of the large protein 
(L) and of the phosphoprotein (P), the latter serving as an obligate polymerase 
cofactor and as a chaperon for N. Both the N and P proteins are enriched in 
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), i.e. regions devoid of stable secondary 
and tertiary structure. N possesses a C-terminal IDR (NTAIL), while P consists 
of a large, intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal 
domain (CTD) encompassing alternating disordered and ordered regions. The V and 
W proteins, two non-structural proteins that are encoded by the P gene via a 
mechanism of co-transcriptional edition of the P mRNA, are prevalently 
disordered too, sharing with P the disordered NTD. They are key players in the 
evasion of the host antiviral response and were shown to phase separate and to 
form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. In this review, we summarize the available 
information on IDRs within the N, P, V and W proteins from these three model 
paramyxoviruses and describe their molecular partnership. We discuss the 
functional benefit of disorder to virus replication in light of the critical 
role of IDRs in affording promiscuity, multifunctionality, fine regulation of 
interaction strength, scaffolding functions and in promoting liquid-liquid phase 
separation and fibrillation.

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in protein sequences are flexible, have 
low structural constraints and as a result have faster rates of evolution. This 
lack of evolutionary conservation greatly limits the use of sequence homology 
for the classification and functional assessment of IDRs, as opposed to globular 
domains. The study of IDRs requires other properties for their classification 
and functional prediction. While composition bias is not a necessary property of 
IDRs, compositionally biased regions (CBRs) have been noted as frequent part of 
IDRs. We hypothesized that to characterize IDRs, it could be helpful to study 
their overlap with particular types of CBRs. Here, we evaluate this overlap in 
the human proteome. A total of 2/3 of residues in IDRs overlap CBRs. Considering 
CBRs enriched in one type of amino acid, we can distinguish CBRs that tend to be 
fully included within long IDRs (R, H, N, D, P, G), from those that partially 
overlap shorter IDRs (S, E, K, T), and others that tend to overlap IDR terminals 
(Q, A). CBRs overlap more often IDRs in nuclear proteins and in proteins 
involved in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Study of protein interaction 
networks reveals the enrichment of CBRs in IDRs by tandem repetition of short 
linear motifs (rich in S or P), and the existence of E-rich polar regions that 
could support specific protein interactions with non-specific interactions. Our 
results open ways to pin down the function of IDRs from their partial 
compositional biases.

Effects of the obstacle-antibody attraction.

This study investigates the behaviour of a fluid of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
when trapped in a confinement represented by rigid spherical obstacles that 
attract antibodies. The antibody molecule is depicted as an assembly of seven 
hard spheres (7-bead model), organized to resemble a Y-shaped object. The model 
antibody has two Fab and one Fc domains located in the corners of letter Y. In 
this calculation, only the Fab-Fab and Fab-Fc attractive pairs of interactions 
are effective. The confinement is formed by the randomly distributed 
hard-spheres fixed in space. The spherical obstacles, besides the size 
exclusion, interact with beads of the antibody molecules via the Yukawa 
attractive potential. We applied the combination of the scaled particle theory, 
replica Ornstein-Zernike equations, Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation 
approach and the Flory-Stockmayer theory to calculate: (i) the phase diagram of 
the liquid-liquid phase separation and the percolation threshold, (ii) the 
cluster size distributions, and (iii) the second virial coefficient of the 
protein fluid distributed among the obstacles. All these quantities were 
calculated as functions of the strength of the attraction between the monoclonal 
antibodies, and the monoclonal antibodies and obstacles. The conclusion is that 
while the hard-sphere obstacles decrease the critical density and the critical 
temperature of the mAbs fluid, the effect of the protein-obstacle attraction is 
more complex. Adding an attractive potential to the obstacle-mAbs interaction 
first increases the wideness of the T*-ρ envelope. However, with the further 
increase of the obstacle-mAbs attraction intensity, we observe reversal of the 
effect, the T*-ρ curves become narrower. At some point, depending on the 
obstacle-mAbs interaction, the situation is observed where two different 
temperatures have the same fluid density (re-entry point). In all the cases 
shown here the critical point decreases below the value for the neat fluid, but 
the behaviour with respect to an increase of the strength of the obstacle-mAbs 
attraction is not monotonic. Yet another interesting phenomenon, known in the 
literature as an approach toward the "empty liquid" state, is observed. The 
stability of the "protein droplets", formed by the liquid-liquid phase 
separation, depends on their local environment and temperature.

Here we describe the coupled standardization of two complementary fluorescence 
imaging techniques and apply it to liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates 
formed from an EGFP fluorescent reporter of flowering control locus A (FCA), a 
protein that associates with chromosomal DNA in plants during epigenetic 
regulation of the flowering process. First, we use home-built single-molecule 
Slimfield microscopy to establish a fluorescent protein standard. This sample 
comprises live yeast cells expressing Mig1 protein, a metabolic regulator which 
localizes to the nucleus under conditions of high glucose, fused to the same 
type of EGFP label as for the FCA fusion construct. Then we employ commercial 
confocal AiryScan microscopy to study the same standard. Finally, we demonstrate 
how to quantify FCA-EGFP nuclear condensates in intact root tips at rapid 
timescales and apply this calibration. This method is a valuable approach to 
obtaining single-molecule precise stoichiometry and copy number estimates of 
protein condensates that are integrated into the chromosome architecture of 
plants, using confocal instrumentation that lacks de facto single-molecule 
detection sensitivity.

An effervescence-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction approach 
using three-component deep eutectic solvent based on short-chain and 
medium-chain carboxylic acids and terpenoid was developed for the first time. 
The microextraction procedure was applied to the determination of 
fluoroquinolone antibiotics in foods (milk and shrimp samples) by 
high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. In this 
microextraction procedure three-component deep eutectic solvent acted as a 
proton donor agent and an extractant. The carbon dioxide bubbles caused by the 
fast reaction between precursor of deep eutectic solvent (short-chain carboxylic 
acid) and effervescent agent (sodium carbonate) promoted the dispersion of the 
extractant in an aqueous sample phase. Various carboxylic acids were studied as 
hydrogen bond donors for the formation of deep eutectic solvents and proton 
donor agents for the generation of CO2 bubbles. Two natural terpenoids (menthol 
and thymol) were studied as the hydrogen bond acceptors for the formation of 
three-component solvent. The extraction system based on heptanoic acid and 
thymol (1:2, mol/mol) containing formic acid (proton donor for generating CO2 
bubbles) provided maximum extraction recovery (86-99%) and a higher extraction 
efficiency of analytes compared to their extraction into individual hydrophobic 
precursors of the system. The LODs, calculated from the blank tests based on 3σ, 
were varied from 0.03 to 0.06 μg L-1 and from 0.3 to 0.6 μg kg-1 for 
fluoroquinolone antibiotics in milk and shrimp samples, respectively. The 
proposed approach provided effective dispersion of extractant speeding up the 
extraction process and fast separation of phases without any external energy 
assistance.

Biomolecular condensates are cellular organelles formed through liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) that play critical roles in cellular functions including 
signaling, transcription, translation, and stress response. Importantly, 
condensate misregulation is associated with human diseases, including 
neurodegeneration and cancer among others. When condensate-forming biomolecules 
are fluorescently-labeled and examined with fluorescence microscopy they appear 
as illuminated foci, or puncta, in cells. Puncta features such as number, 
volume, shape, location, and concentration of biomolecular species within them 
are influenced by the thermodynamics of biomolecular interactions that underlie 
LLPS. Quantification of puncta features enables evaluation of the thermodynamic 
driving force for LLPS and facilitates quantitative comparisons of puncta formed 
under different cellular conditions or by different biomolecules. Our work on 
nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) fusion oncoproteins (FOs) associated with pediatric 
leukemia inspired us to develop an objective and reliable computational approach 
for such analyses. The NUP98-HOXA9 FO forms hundreds of punctate transcriptional 
condensates in cells, leading to hematopoietic cell transformation and 
leukemogenesis. To quantify the features of these puncta and derive the 
associated thermodynamic parameters, we developed a live-cell fluorescence 
microscopy image processing pipeline based on existing methodologies and 
open-source tools. The pipeline quantifies the numbers and volumes of puncta and 
fluorescence intensities of the fluorescently-labeled biomolecule(s) within them 
and generates reports of their features for hundreds of cells. Using a standard 
curve of fluorescence intensity versus protein concentration, the pipeline 
determines the apparent molar concentration of fluorescently-labeled 
biomolecules within and outside of puncta and calculates the partition 
coefficient (Kp) and Gibbs free energy of transfer (ΔGTr), which quantify the 
favorability of a labeled biomolecule partitioning into puncta. In addition, we 
provide a library of R functions for statistical analysis of the extracted 
measurements for certain experimental designs. The source code, analysis 
notebooks, and test data for the Punctatools pipeline are available on GitHub: 
https://github.com/stjude/punctatools. Here, we provide a protocol for applying 
our Punctatools pipeline to extract puncta features from fluorescence microscopy 
images of cells.

Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) C. Jeffrey, belonging to the family 
Cucurbitaceae, is a natural sweetener. The roots of this plant are used in folk 
medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Cucurbitacins play an 
important role in the resistance of this plant to insects and adversity, and 
have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and other biological activities. They 
usually exist as a variety of similar structures in Cucurbitaceae plants. 
Separation of a large amount of high-purity monomer compounds by the 
conventional separation method based on column chromatography is difficult, 
which limits the research and application of their activities. Therefore, we 
chose a new method for this separation. High-speed countercurrent chromatography 
(HSCCC) is a liquid-liquid chromatographic technique characterized by high 
recovery and reproducibility, and is considered a very effective method for the 
separation of natural compounds present in various plant extracts. An 
appropriate solvent system is the key for efficient separation, but its 
selection is tedious, which hampers the wider implementation of HSCCC in 
chemical research involving preparative separations. In this study, based on the 
general estimation strategy by using the TLC solvent system (GUESS), the 
corresponding relationship between the partition distribution coefficient (K 
value) and the TLC retention factor (Rf value) of the compounds was established 
by the partition experiment. The Rf value and separation coefficient α were 
calculated using the water-saturated organic phase as the expansion agent, which 
could minimize the number of countercurrent separation experiments required in 
solvent system selection. In this study, HSCCC was used to establish an 
efficient method for the extraction of cucurbitacins from the root extract of 
Siraitia grosvenorii. A fraction rich in cucurbitacins was obtained from the 
ethanol extract of Siraitia grosvenorii roots after separation by column 
chromatography on HPD-100, MCI, and C18 columns. Six types of solvent systems 
with different compositions were investigated using the GUESS method. The 
results showed that employing the solvent system of n-hexane-ethyl 
acetate-methanol-water (3∶7∶3∶7, v/v/v/v) to partition the cucurbitacin fraction 
could remove a large number of impurities. The components retained in the upper 
phase in the partition experiment were subsequently purified by HSCCC. The 
favorable solvent system for HSCCC was n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water 
(4∶6∶5∶5, v/v/v/v), while the upper and lower phases were selected as the 
stationary and mobile phases, respectively, with a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min, a 
rotation speed of 860 r/min, and an injected sample weight of 280 mg. Five 
cucurbitacin compounds were obtained by one-time separation. The weights of the 
five compounds were 14.73, 8.82, 30.74, 5.03, and 3.81 mg. The purities of these 
compounds were 97.0%, 95.4%, 96.3%, 91.6%, and 95.3%, respectively. Their 
structures were identified as cucurbitacin Q1, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin 
F-25-acetate, cucurbitacin B, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B, and 
dihydroisocucurbitacin B-25-acetate by1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopies, along 
with comparison with the literature. This study demonstrated how GUESS guidance 
accelerates the selection of HSCCC solvent systems, simplifies the workflow, and 
it provides an efficient preparative method for the separation of chemical 
constituents from the Siraitia grosvenorii roots, which can also be used as a 
new method for the large-scale preparation of cucurbitacin compounds.

The RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP) is a potent activator of mRNA 
decay, specifically for transcripts bearing AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 
3'-untranslated regions. TTP functions as a mediator for mRNA decay by 
interacting with the decay machinery and recruiting it to the target ARE-mRNA. 
In this study, we report a weak, but direct interaction between TTP and the 
human decapping enzyme DCP2, which impacts the stability of ARE transcripts. The 
TTP-DCP2 interaction is unusual as it involves intrinsically disordered regions 
(IDRs) of both binding partners. We show that the IDR of DCP2 has a propensity 
for oligomerization and liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. Binding of TTP 
to DCP2 leads to its partitioning into phase-separated droplets formed by DCP2, 
suggesting that molecular crowding might facilitate the weak interaction between 
the two proteins and enable assembly of a decapping-competent mRNA-protein 
complex on TTP-bound transcripts in cells. Our studies underline the role of 
weak interactions in the cellular interaction network and their contribution 
towards cellular functionality.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is emerging as a key physical principle 
for biological organization inside living cells, forming condensates that play 
important regulatory roles. Inside living nuclei, transcription factor (TF) 
condensates regulate transcriptional initiation and amplify the transcriptional 
output of expressed genes. However, the biophysical parameters controlling TF 
condensation are still poorly understood. Here we applied a battery of 
single-molecule imaging, theory, and simulations to investigate the physical 
properties of TF condensates of the progesterone receptor (PR) in living cells. 
Analysis of individual PR trajectories at different ligand concentrations showed 
marked signatures of a ligand-tunable LLPS process. Using a machine learning 
architecture, we found that receptor diffusion within condensates follows 
fractional Brownian motion resulting from viscoelastic interactions with 
chromatin. Interestingly, condensate growth dynamics at shorter times is 
dominated by Brownian motion coalescence (BMC), followed by a growth plateau at 
longer timescales that result in nanoscale condensate sizes. To rationalize 
these observations, we extended on the BMC model by including the stochastic 
unbinding of particles within condensates. Our model reproduced the BMC behavior 
together with finite condensate sizes at the steady state, fully recapitulating 
our experimental data. Overall, our results are consistent with condensate 
growth dynamics being regulated by the escaping probability of PR molecules from 
condensates. The interplay between condensation assembly and molecular escaping 
maintains an optimum physical condensate size. Such phenomena must have 
implications for the biophysical regulation of other nuclear condensates and 
could also operate in multiple biological scenarios.

A lab-in-syringe flow system exploiting dispersive liquid-liquid 
micro-extraction in a solvent lighter than water is proposed for the 
spectrophotometric determination of lead in industrial residual waters. The 
steps inherent to both liquid-liquid extraction and monitoring of the formed 
compound are in-syringe carried out. The classical carbon tetrachloride is not 
used as the extracting solvent, as it does not present the friendly 
characteristics inherent to the Green Analytical Chemistry. Aiming at a cleaner 
alternative for this determination, xylene is selected. Enrichment factor, 
linear dynamic range, detection limit, sample throughput and residue volume 
inherent to the proposed procedure were estimated as 36, 50.0-250 μg L-1, 
9.0 μg L-1, 13 h-1, and 2.0 mL, respectively.

Molecular crowding is an inherent feature of cell interiors. Synthetic cells as 
provided by giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) encapsulating macromolecules 
(poly(ethylene glycol) and dextran) represent an excellent mimetic system to 
study membrane transformations associated with molecular crowding and protein 
condensation. Similarly to cells, such GUVs exhibit highly curved structures 
like nanotubes. Upon liquid-liquid phase separation their membrane deforms into 
apparent kinks at the contact line of the interface between the two aqueous 
phases. These structures, nanotubes, and kinks, have dimensions below optical 
resolution. Here, these are studied with super-resolution stimulated emission 
depletion (STED) microscopy facilitated by immobilization in a microfluidic 
device. The cylindrical nature of the nanotubes based on the superior resolution 
of STED and automated data analysis is demonstrated. The deduced membrane 
spontaneous curvature is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. 
Furthermore, the membrane kink-like structure is resolved as a smoothly curved 
membrane demonstrating the existence of the intrinsic contact angle, which 
describes the wettability contrast of the encapsulated phases to the membrane. 
Resolving these highly curved membrane structures with STED imaging provides 
important insights in the membrane properties and interactions underlying 
cellular activities.

Multi-domain proteins or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often undergo 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form membraneless organelles or 
protein condensates. Such compartmentalization is considered critical in many 
cellular processes dynamically modulated by various external signals. However, 
molecular mechanisms underlying potential regulatory functions of the protein 
condensates remain obscure due to a limited understanding of the driving forces 
for their assembly. Here we propose isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as an 
efficient analytical tool to dissociate condensates and measure the 
corresponding dissociation heat. Subsequent analysis of the initial dissociation 
heat as a function of total protein concentration allows simple and accurate 
determination of the thermodynamic parameters for cooperative condensate 
formations including the dissociation (or condensation) enthalpy and the 
critical protein concentration. By performing systematic simulations, we further 
demonstrate that the initial heat analysis is sufficiently robust to 
quantitatively dissect protein condensates with a broad range of thermodynamic 
properties. Therefore, our proposed method analyzing the initial heat measured 
in dissociation ITC provides opportunities to further scrutinize the 
thermodynamic quantities as functions of solution variables to explore the 
molecular driving forces of LLPS.

DNA is an excellent material for constructing self-assembled 
nano/microstructures. Owing to the widespread use of DNA as a building block in 
laboratories and industry, it is desirable to increase the efficiency of all 
steps involved in producing self-assembled DNA structures. One of the 
bottlenecks is the purification required to separate the excess components from 
the target structures. This paper describes a purification method based on the 
fractionation by water-in-water (W/W) droplets composed of phase-separated 
dextran-rich droplets in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-rich continuous phase. The 
dextran-rich droplets facilitate the selective uptake of self-assembled DNA 
nano/microstructures and allow the separation of the target structure. This 
study investigates the ability to purify DNA origami, DNA hydrogels, and DNA 
microtubes. The W/W-droplet fractionation allows the purification of structures 
of a broad size spectrum without changes to the protocol. By quantifying the 
activity of deoxyribozyme-modified DNA origami after W/W-droplet purification, 
this study demonstrates that this method sufficiently preserves the 
accessibility to the surface of a functional DNA nanostructure. It is considered 
that the W/W-droplet fractionation could become one of the standard methods for 
the purification of self-assembled DNA nano/microstructures for biomedical and 
nanotechnology applications owing to its low cost and simplicity.

Zilpaterol is a β2 -adrenergic agonist and a repartitioning agent that has a 
high potential for abuse in equine performance athletes. Analysis of zilpaterol 
in hair is an alternative sampling matrix that extends detection time periods 
beyond those found in urine or blood samples. Our laboratory has been screening 
for zilpaterol in hair for many years and recently detected and confirmed its 
presence in official samples. Accordingly, a liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry method was developed and validated to detect and confirm zilpaterol 
in equine hair. Briefly, equine hair was decontaminated, cut, and pulverized 
prior to disruption and liquid-liquid extraction in basic conditions. Following 
extraction, the sample was introduced to an Agilent 1260 HPLC and zilpaterol was 
separated using a reverse phase gradient with a total run time of 12.5 min. 
Following chromatographic separation, zilpaterol and its corresponding stable 
isotope labeled internal standard were introduced via positive mode electrospray 
ionization to a Thermo Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer and spectra collected 
using parallel reaction monitoring. The methodology was validated using in-house 
criteria including characterization of accuracy, precision, recovery, linear 
range, matrix effects, limit of detection, and limit of quantitation, and the 
method was found to be fit-for-purpose to confirm the presence of zilpaterol in 
equine hair. This methodology has been used to detect and confirm the presence 
of zilpaterol from out-of-competition hair samples submitted by regional racing 
authorities.

The functions of mammalian Atg8 proteins (mATG8s) expand beyond canonical 
autophagy and include processes collectively referred to as Atg8ylation. Global 
modulation of protein synthesis under stress conditions is governed by MTOR and 
liquid-liquid phase separated condensates containing ribonucleoprotein particles 
known as stress granules (SGs). We report that lysosomal damage induces SGs 
acting as a hitherto unappreciated inhibitor of protein translation via 
EIF2A/eIF2α phosphorylation while favoring an ATF4-dependent integrated stress 
response. SGs are induced by lysosome-damaging agents, SARS-CoV-2 open reading 
frame 3a protein (ORF3a) expression, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and 
exposure to proteopathic MAPT/tau. Proteomic studies revealed recruitment to 
damaged lysosomes of the core SG proteins NUFIP2 and G3BP1 along with the 
GABARAPs of the mATG8 family. The recruitment of these proteins is independent 
of SG condensates or canonical autophagy. GABARAPs interact directly with NUFIP2 
and G3BP1 whereas Atg8ylation is needed for their recruitment to damaged 
lysosomes. At the lysosome, NUFIP2 contributes to MTOR inactivation together 
with LGALS8 (galectin 8) via the Ragulator-RRAGA-RRAGB complex. The separable 
functions of NUFIP2 and G3BP1 in SG formation vis-a-vis their role in MTOR 
inactivation are governed by GABARAP and Atg8ylation. Thus, cells employ 
membrane Atg8ylation to control and coordinate SG and MTOR responses to 
lysosomal damage.Abbreviations: Atg8: autophagy related 8; ATG: autophagy

T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) plays a central role in stress granule 
(SG) formation by self-assembly via the prion-like domain (PLD). In the TIA-1 
PLD, amino acid mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Welander distal myopathy (WDM), have been 
identified. However, how these mutations affect PLD self-assembly properties has 
remained elusive. In this study, we uncovered the implicit pathogenic structures 
caused by the mutations. NMR analysis indicated that the dynamic structures of 
the PLD are synergistically determined by the physicochemical properties of 
amino acids in units of five residues. Molecular dynamics simulations and 
three-dimensional electron crystallography, together with biochemical assays, 
revealed that the WDM mutation E384K attenuated the sticky properties, whereas 
the ALS mutations P362L and A381T enhanced the self-assembly by inducing β-sheet 
interactions and highly condensed assembly, respectively. These results suggest 
that the P362L and A381T mutations increase the likelihood of irreversible 
amyloid fibrillization after phase-separated droplet formation, and this process 
may lead to pathogenicity.

Constrained Coding Regions (CCRs) in the human genome have been derived from DNA 
sequencing data of large cohorts of healthy control populations, available in 
the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) [1]. They identify regions depleted of 
protein-changing variants and thus identify segments of the genome that have 
been constrained during human evolution. By mapping these DNA-defined regions 
from genomic coordinates onto the corresponding protein positions and combining 
this information with protein annotations, we have explored the distribution of 
CCRs and compared their co-occurrence with different protein functional 
features, previously annotated at the amino acid level in public databases. As 
expected, our results reveal that functional amino acids involved in 
interactions with DNA/RNA, protein-protein contacts and catalytic sites are the 
protein features most likely to be highly constrained for variation in the 
control population. More surprisingly, we also found that linear motifs, linear 
interacting peptides (LIPs), disorder-order transitions upon binding with other 
protein partners and liquid-liquid phase separating (LLPS) regions are also 
strongly associated with high constraint for variability. We also compared 
intra-species constraints in the human CCRs with inter-species conservation and 
functional residues to explore how such CCRs may contribute to the analysis of 
protein variants. As has been previously observed, CCRs are only weakly 
correlated with conservation, suggesting that intraspecies constraints 
complement interspecies conservation and can provide more information to 
interpret variant effects.

In this work, iron (III) oxinate magnetic nanocomposite was synthesized and 
employed as an efficient sorbent for the magnetic dispersive solid-phase 
extraction of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from honey samples. In the 
following, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure was used for 
further preconcentration of the analytes. The prepared sorbent was characterized 
using Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry, X-ray diffractometry, 
vibrating sample magnetometry, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and 
scanning electron microscopy. The results verified the successful formation of 
the magnetic sorbent. In the extraction process, the sorbent was added into an 
aqueous solution and the mixture was vortexed. After completing the adsorption 
process, the supernatant phase was separated in the presence of a magnet and the 
analytes adsorbed onto sorbent were eluted by acetonitrile. Then, 
microliter-level 1,1,1-trichloroethane was mixed with the obtained acetonitrile 
and injected into NaCl solution. Finally, one microliter of the sedimented phase 
was injected into gas chromatography-flame ionization detector after 
centrifugation. Under the optimum conditions, a great repeatability (relative 
standard deviation equal or less than 5 and 6% for intra- and interday 
precisions, respectively), acceptable extraction recoveries (59-84%), high 
enrichment factors (118-168), and low limits of detection and quantification 
(0.16-0.36 and 0.56-1.22 ng/g, respectively) were acquired.

Large-scale preparation of target compounds from complex samples is facing great 
challenges. In the present study, an efficient strategy for large-scale 
preparation of target compound was proposed and successfully applied in the 
separation of active components from Toona sinensis. The pretreatment technology 
of liquid-liquid refining extraction (LLRE) combined with consecutive high-speed 
counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was used to process hundred grams of 
extractions. Firstly, two phase solvent systems composed of n-hexane-ethyl 
acetate-methanol-water (5:5:5:5, v/v) and (2:5:2:5, v/v) were used to remove low 
polar and high polar impurities from 100 g crude extracts of T. sinensis, 
respectively, and 9.25 g of crude sample was obtained. And then, n-hexane-ethyl 
acetate-methanol-water (2.5:5:2.5:5, v/v) was used as the solvent system for 
HSCCC separation. The isocratic elution mode with max loading and consecutive 
injections mode were investigated to obtain more target compound. As a result, 
ethyl gallate with purity of 97% was successfully separated by 5 times 
consecutive counter-current chromatography. The separation was repeated once. 
Finally, ethyl gallate (3.73 g) was isolated from 9.25 g of crude sample (100 g 
crude extracts). The results demonstrated that the yield increased from 
0.26 g/h/L of untreated crude extract to 0.93 g/h/L of LLRE pre-treated sample 
for single injection, and further increased to 1.62 g/h/L for 5 consecutive 
injections mode with the present method.

Background: Favipiravir is an antiviral drug that was recently approved for the 
management of COVID-19 infection. Aim: This work aimed to develop a new method, 
using sugaring-out induced homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction followed by 
HPLC/UV for the determination of favipiravir in human plasma. Materials & 
methods: The optimum extraction conditions were attained using 500 μl of 
tetrahydrofuran as an extractant and 1400 mg of fructose as a phase-separating 
agent. Results: The developed method was validated according to the US FDA 
bioanalytical guidelines and was found linear in the range of 25-80,000 ng/ml 
with a correlation coefficient of 0.999. Conclusion: These results showed that 
the developed method was simple, easy, valid and adequately sensitive for 
determination of favipiravir in plasma for bioequivalence studies.

Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a DNA/RNA-binding protein that is involved in DNA 
repair and RNA processing. FUS is associated with neurodegenerative diseases 
such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). 
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying FUS-mediated neurodegeneration are 
largely unknown. Here, using a Drosophila model, we showed that the 
overexpression of glutathione transferase omega 2 (GstO2) reduces cytoplasmic 
FUS aggregates and prevents neurodegenerative phenotypes, including 
neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. We found a FUS glutathionylation 
site at the 447th cysteine residue in the RanBP2-type ZnF domain. The 
glutathionylation of FUS induces FUS aggregation by promoting phase separation. 
GstO2 reduced cytoplasmic FUS aggregation by deglutathionylation in Drosophila 
brains. Moreover, we demonstrated that the overexpression of human GSTO1, the 
homolog of Drosophila GstO2, attenuates FUS-induced neurotoxicity and 
cytoplasmic FUS accumulation in mouse neuronal cells. Thus, the modulation of 
FUS glutathionylation might be a promising therapeutic strategy for 
FUS-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

The performance of organic solar cells strongly depends on the 
bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of the photoactive layer. This BHJ forms 
during the drying of the wet-deposited solution, because of physical processes 
such as crystallization and/or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, 
the process-structure relationship remains insufficiently understood. In this 
work, a recently developed, coupled phase-field-fluid mechanics framework is 
used to simulate the BHJ formation upon drying. For the first time, this allows 
to investigate the interplay between all the relevant physical processes 
(evaporation, crystal nucleation and growth, liquid demixing, 
composition-dependent kinetic properties), within a single coherent theoretical 
framework. Simulations for the model system P3HT-PCBM are presented. The 
comparison with previously reported in situ characterization of the drying 
structure is very convincing: The morphology formation pathways, crystallization 
kinetics, and final morphology are in line with experimental results. The final 
BHJ morphology is a subtle mixture of pure crystalline donor and acceptor 
phases, pure and mixed amorphous domains, which depends on the process 
parameters and material properties. The expected benefit of such an approach is 
to identify physical design rules for ink formulation and processing conditions 
to optimize the cell's performance. It could be applied to recent organic 
material systems in the future.

Liquid-liquid extraction of lanthanide (Ln) ions was investigated using 
N,N-dioctylthiodiglycolamic acid (DOTDGAA), which is a sulfur donor ligand with 
an amide group and a carboxyl group connected by a thioether chain. The 
extraction performance and selectivity of DOTDGAA for Ln ions were compared with 
those of N,N-dioctyldiglycolamic acid (DODGAA), which is also an oxygen donor 
ligand with a similar chemical structure, to assess the effect of the soft/hard 
donor atom on Ln separation. DOTDGAA quantitatively extracted all Ln ions while 
being selective toward the light and middle Ln ions, in contrast to the 
selectivity of DODGAA for heavier Ln ions. Slope analysis demonstrated that the 
Ln3+ transfer using DOTDGAA proceeded through a proton-exchange reaction, 
forming a 1:3 complex, Ln(DOTDGAA)3. The back-extraction of Ln ions from the 
extracting phase was successfully achieved under acidic conditions.

Owing to their biocompatibility, optical, and catalytic properties, Au 
nanoparticles (NPs) have been the subject of much research. Since smaller NPs 
have enhanced catalytic properties and NP morphology greatly impacts their 
effectiveness, controlled and reproducible methods of generating Au NPs are 
still being sought. Herein, Au NPs were electrochemically generated at a 
water|ionic liquid (w|IL) immiscible micro-interface, 25 µm in diameter, using a 
redox active IL and compared to results at a water|oil (w|o) one. The 
liquid|liquid interface is advantageous as it is pristine and highly 
reproducible, as well as an excellent means of species and charge separation. In 
this system, KAuCl4 dissolved in the aqueous phase reacts under external 
potential control at the water|P8888TB (tetraoctylphosphonium 
tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate) with trioctyl(ferrocenylhexanoyl)phosphonium 
tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (FcIL), an electron donor and redox active IL. 
FcIL was prepared with a common anion to P8888TB, which greatly enhances its 
solubility in the bulk IL. Simple ion transfer of AuCl4- and AuCl(4-γ)(OH)γ- at 
the w|P8888TB micro-interface were characterized voltammetrically as well as 
their heterogeneous electron transfer reaction with FcIL. This interfacial 
reaction generates Au NPs whose size can be thermodynamically controlled by 
modifying the pH of the aqueous phase. Critically, at low pH, nanoclusters, 
&lt;1.7 nm in diameter, were generated owing to inhibited thermodynamics in 
combination with the supramolecular fluidic nature of the IL microenvironment 
that was observed surrounding the as-prepared NPs.

The SynGAP/PSD-95 binary protein system serves as a simple mimicry of 
postsynaptic densities (PSDs), which are protein assemblies based largely on 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), that are located underneath the plasma 
membrane of excitatory synapses. Surprisingly, the LLPS of the SynGAP/PSD-95 
system is much more pressure sensitive than typical folded states of proteins or 
nucleic acids. It was found that phase-separated SynGAP/PSD-95 droplets dissolve 
into a homogeneous solution at a pressure of tens to hundred bar. Since 
organisms in the deep sea are exposed to pressures of up to ∼1000 bar, this 
observation suggests that deep-sea organisms must counteract the high pressure 
sensitivity of PSDs to avoid neurological impairment. We demonstrate here that 
the compatible osmolyte trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) as well as macromolecular 
crowding agents at moderate concentrations can mitigate the deleterious effect 
of pressure on SynGAP/PSD-95 droplet stability, extending stable LLPS up to 
almost a kbar level. Moreover, the formation of SynGAP/PSD-95 droplets is a very 
rapid process that can be switched on and off in seconds. In contrast with the 
marked effects of the cosolutes on droplet stability, at the cosolutes' 
respective biologically relevant concentrations, their impact on the phase 
transformation kinetics is rather small. Only a high TMAO concentration results 
in a significant kinetic retardation of LLPS. Taken together, these findings 
offer new biophysical insights into the neurological effects of hydrostatic 
pressure. In particular, our results indicate how pressure-induced neurological 
disorders might be alleviated by upregulating certain cosolutes in the cellular 
milieu.

A green, fast, and efficient pH-induced natural deep eutectic solvent combined 
with vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method 
(pH-NADES-VA-DLLME) followed by HPLC was established for determination of 
ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and enrofloxacin (ENR) in honey. In this 
method, NaOH, as an emulsifier, can increase the contact area between the NADES 
and the sample solution, which can efficiently improve the extraction efficiency 
of the analytes. Moreover, HCl acts as the phase separation agent without 
centrifugation in the process, which can greatly enhance the efficiency of the 
sample analysis process. In addition, the main factors affecting the extraction 
effect were optimized by single factor experiments. Under the optimal 
conditions, the limits of detection (LODs), the limits of quantification (LOQs) 
and recoveries were in the range of 0.004-0.015 μg mL-1, 0.012-0.050 μg mL-1, 
and 98.0-112.5%, respectively. The RSD values of intra-day and inter-day 
precisions were no more than 5.5% and 6.0%, respectively. The developed method 
was successfully applied to determine the three quinolone antibiotics in honey.

The hazardous nature of certain azeotropic mixtures has urged the researchers to 
explore the separation techniques which can impart a contamination free 
environment. Despite of causing environmental concerns, these azeotropic 
mixtures are responsible for causing serious health issues to humans and 
animals. More specifically, in this article, we have taken Tetrahydrofuran (THF) 
- water azeotropic mixture into consideration. It has been reported that it 
affects the central nervous system, liver, as well as can cause carcinogenicity. 
To be more precise, in this article, two different entrainers has been evaluated 
on their merits of exploiting liquid-liquid phase envelope for separating 
Tetrahydrofuran-water binary azeotropic mixture. The process flow sheet 
schematic with n-octane as entrainer (having two distillation regions) has a 
reduced operating energy requirement by 21.11% while comparing with the Residue 
Curve Map of n-hexane as entrainer having three distillation regions. The total 
capital cost for THF-water-n-octane case has been found to be 7.1 $/y × 105 and 
that of THF-water-n-hexane case has been found to be 9 $/y × 105. However, in 
both of the cases, the product purity of 99.9% has been achieved for THF. Also, 
the classical trade-off between capital cost and energy cost has been shown in 
this study. The salient feature of this work is the use of dynamic simulation to 
understand the effect of recycle flow rate induced process operational 
in-feasibility due to distillation region shift.

Core-sheath fibers have numerous applications ranging from composite materials 
for advanced manufacturing to materials for drug delivery and regenerative 
medicine. Here, a simple and tunable approach for the generation of core-sheath 
fibers from immiscible solutions of dextran and polyethylene oxide is described. 
This approach exploits the entanglement of polymer molecules within the dextran 
and polyethylene oxide phases for free surface spinning into dry fibers. The 
mechanism by which these core-sheath fibers are produced after contact with a 
solid substrate (such as a microneedle) involves complex flows of the 
phase-separating polymer solutions, giving rise to a liquid-liquid core-sheath 
flow that is drawn into a liquid bridge. This liquid bridge then elongates into 
a core-sheath fiber through extensional flow as the contacting substrate is 
withdrawn. The core-sheath structure of the fibers produced by this approach is 
confirmed by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy 
and confocal microscopy. Tuning of the core diameter is also demonstrated by

In the present study, a simple and low cost methodology based on ultrasonic 
assisted-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UA-DLLME) followed by 
smartphone-based colorimetric measurement was introduced for the separation and 
determination of Triclosan (TCS) from contaminated waters. This method is based 
on the formation of an azo compound from the alkaline reaction of TCS with a 
diazonium ion, resulting from the reaction of sodium nitrite and p-sulfanilic 
acid in an acidic medium. The orange-brown color product was extracted into a 
low volume of organic phase by UA-DLLME method and RGB values were recorded with 
free Android app Color Grab. The effective parameters in this procedure, namely 
solution pH, p-sulfanilic acid and nitrite concentration, reaction time and 
volume of the extraction solvent were investigated and optimized by response 
surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD) model. Under 
optimum conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the range of 3.0 and 
200 μg L-1 of TCS. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification 
(LOQ) were 0.8 and 2.7 μg L-1, respectively. The proposed method was 
successfullyused for the analyses of triclosan in several water and wastewater 
samples and satisfactory results were obtained.

We previously discovered that exogenously expressed GFP-tagged cytoplasmic human 
myxovirus resistance protein (MxA), a major antiviral effector of Type I and III 
interferons (IFNs) against several RNA- and DNA-containing viruses, existed in 
the cytoplasm in phase-separated membraneless biomolecular condensates of 
varying sizes and shapes with osmotically regulated disassembly and reassembly. 
In this study we investigated whether cytoplasmic IFN-α-induced endogenous human 
MxA structures were also biomolecular condensates, displayed hypotonic 
osmoregulation and the mechanisms involved. Both IFN-α-induced endogenous MxA 
and exogenously expressed GFP-MxA formed cytoplasmic condensates in A549 lung 
and Huh7 hepatoma cells which rapidly disassembled within 1-2 min when cells 
were exposed to 1,6-hexanediol or to hypotonic buffer (~40-50 mOsm). Both 
reassembled into new structures within 1-2 min of shifting cells to isotonic 
culture medium (~330 mOsm). Strikingly, MxA condensates in cells continuously 
exposed to culture medium of moderate hypotonicity (in the range one-fourth, 
one-third or one-half isotonicity; range 90-175 mOsm) first rapidly disassembled 
within 1-3 min, and then, in most cells, spontaneously reassembled 7-15 min 
later into new structures. This spontaneous reassembly was inhibited by 
2-deoxyglucose (thus, was ATP-dependent) and by dynasore (thus, required 
membrane internalization). Indeed, condensate reassembly was preceded by 
crowding of the cytosolic space by large vacuole-like dilations (VLDs) derived 
from internalized plasma membrane. Remarkably, the antiviral activity of GFP-MxA 
against vesicular stomatitis virus survived hypoosmolar disassembly and 
subsequent reassembly. The data highlight the exquisite osmosensitivity of MxA 
condensates, and the preservation of antiviral activity in the face of hypotonic 
stress.

The condensation of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies, cytoplasmic 
P-granules, P-bodies (PBs), and stress granules is reversible and dynamic via 
liquid-liquid phase separation. Although each condensate comprises hundreds of 
proteins with promiscuous interactions, a few key scaffold proteins are 
required. Essential scaffold domain sequence elements, such as poly-Q, 
low-complexity regions, oligomerizing domains, and RNA-binding domains, have 
been evaluated to understand their roles in biomolecular condensation processes. 
However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We analyzed Nst1, a 
PB-associated protein that can intrinsically induce PB component condensations 
when overexpressed. Various Nst1 domain deletion mutants with unique sequence 
distributions, including intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and 
aggregation-prone regions, were constructed based on structural predictions. The 
overexpression of Nst1 deletion mutants lacking the aggregation-prone domain 
(APD) significantly inhibited self-condensation, implicating APD as an 
oligomerizing domain promoting self-condensation. Remarkably, cells 
overexpressing the Nst1 deletion mutant of the polyampholyte domain (PD) in the 
IDR region (Nst1∆PD) rarely accumulate endogenous enhanced green fluorescent 
protein (EGFP)-tagged Dcp2. However, Nst1∆PD formed self-condensates, suggesting 
that Nst1 requires PD to interact with Dcp2, regardless of its 
self-condensation. In Nst1∆PD-overexpressing cells treated with cycloheximide 
(CHX), Dcp2, Xrn1, Dhh1, and Edc3 had significantly diminished condensation 
compared to those in CHX-treated Nst1-overexpressing cells. These observations 
suggest that the PD of the IDR in Nst1 functions as a hub domain interacting 
with other PB components.

Fumaric, malic, and succinic acids have been selectively separated from their 
mixture obtained by Rhizopus oryzae fermentation using reactive extraction with 
Amberlite LA-2 dissolved in three solvents with different dielectric constants 
(n-heptane, n-butyl acetate, and dichloromethane). This technique allows 
recovering preferentially fumaric acid from the mixture, the raffinate 
containing only malic and succinic acids. The extractant concentration and 
organic phase polarity control the efficiency and selectivity of acids 
extraction. The increase of aqueous phase viscosity reduces the extraction yield 
for all studied acids, but exhibits a positively effect on separation 
selectivity. By using Amberlite LA-2 concentration equal to that 
stoichiometrically required for interfacial reaction with fumaric acid and 
mixing intensity which does not allow higher diffusion rates for larger 
molecules (malic and succinic acids), the maximum value of fumaric acid 
extraction rate exceeds 90%, while the selectivity factor value becomes 20. 
Regardless of the extraction system, the complete separation of fumaric acid 
from their mixture is possible by multi-stage extraction process, adjusting the 
extractant concentration in each stage. At higher values of aqueous phase 
viscosity, more extraction stages are required, while the increase of solvent 
polarity reduce the required number of stages for total recovery of fumaric 
acid.

An important characteristic of cell differentiation is its stability. Only 
rarely do cells or their stem cell progenitors change their differentiation 
pathway. If they do, it is often accompanied by a malfunction such as cancer. A 
mechanistic understanding of the stability of differentiated states would allow 
better prospects of alleviating the malfunctioning. However, such complete 
information is yet elusive. Earlier experiments performed in Xenopus oocytes to 
address this question suggest that a cell may maintain its gene expression by 
prolonged binding of cell type-specific transcription factors. Here, using DNA 
competition experiments, we show that the stability of gene expression in a 
nondividing cell could be caused by the local entrapment of part of the general 
transcription machinery in transcriptionally active regions. Strikingly, we 
found that transcriptionally active and silent forms of the same DNA template 
can stably coexist within the same nucleus. Both DNA templates are associated 
with the gene-specific transcription factor Ascl1, the core factor TBP2, and the 
polymerase II (Pol-II) ser5 C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylated form, while 
Pol-II ser2 CTD phosphorylation is restricted to the transcriptionally dominant 
template. We discover that the active and silent DNA forms are physically 
separated in the oocyte nucleus through partition into liquid-liquid 
phase-separated condensates. Altogether, our study proposes a mechanism of 
transcriptional regulation involving a spatial entrapment of general 
transcription machinery components to stabilize the active form of a gene in a 
nondividing cell.

In this study, an efficient preconcentration method was presented that is based 
on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction taking the advantage of newly 
synthesized phosphonium deep eutectic solvents used as extractants and 
ultrasound probe as a dispersing agent. The extracts obtained were analyzed by 
high-performance liquid chromatography. To optimize the five most important 
factors for the microextraction procedure a central composite design plan was 
used. Under optimal conditions (140 μl of extractant, 60 mg of NaCl, pH = 2.0, 
120 s of extraction time with ultrasound probe as the dispersing agent, 16 min 
of centrifugation for phase separation), the proposed method allowed to achieve 
good precision with RSD between 3.2% and 9.7% at 1.0, 5.0 and 40.0 ng ml levels. 
The preconcentration factors were equal to 42, 39, and 41, and the limits of 
detection 0.128, 0.103, and 0.135 ng/ml for dicamba, 
2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxypropionic acid, 
respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination 
of chlorophenoxy acid herbicides in water samples from drainage ditches with a 
good recovery in the range of 70%-93%.

Stress granules (SGs) are cytosolic, nonmembranous RNA-protein (RNP) complexes 
that form in the cytosol of many cells under various stress conditions and can 
integrate responses to various stressors. Although physiological SG formation 
appears to be an adaptive and survival-promoting mechanism, inappropriate 
formation or chronic persistence of SGs has been linked to aging and various 
neurodegenerative diseases. The quantitative monitoring of the dynamics of SG 
components in living nerve cells can therefore be an important tool for 
identifying conditions that disrupt SG function and lead to disease-related 
attacks in the cells. Here, we describe a method for the quantitative 
determination of the distribution and shuttling dynamics of components of SGs in 
living model neurons by fluorescence decay after photoactivation (FDAP) 
measurements using a standard confocal laser scanning microscope. The method 
includes lipofection of photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (paGFP) fused 
to an SG protein of interest in a neural cell line, differentiation of the cells 
into a neuronal phenotype, focal activation using a blue diode (405 nm), and 
recording of decay curves with a 488 nm laser line. By modeling the decay 
measurements with FDAP functions, the approach enables estimating the residence 
time of the SG protein of interest, determining the proportion of the respective 
component in SGs, and the detection of possible changes after experimental 
manipulation.

A new method was developed for pre-concentration and determination of multiple 
drugs of abuse in human urine using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 
(DLLME) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) with photodiode array detection. The 
method was based on the formation of tiny droplets of an organic extractant in 
the prepared sample solution using water-immiscible organic solvent (chloroform) 
dissolved in water-miscible organic dispersive solvent (isopropyl alcohol). The 
organic phase, which extracted eight drugs of abuse from the prepared urine 
solution, was separated by centrifugation. The sedimented phase was transferred 
into a small volume CE auto-sampler vial with 10 µL of 1% HCl methanol solution 
and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted in lidocaine 
hydrochloride (internal standard) aqueous solution and introduced by 
electrokinetic injection into CE. Under the optimum conditions, acceptable 
linear relationship was observed in the range of 3.0-500 ng/mL with the 
correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9982-0.9994 for spiked urine samples. The limit 
of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) was estimated to be 1.0 ng/mL. A recovery of 
75.7%-90.6% was obtained for spiked samples. The mean relative error (MRE) was 
within ±7.0% and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 6.9%. The 
proposed DLLME-CE procedure offers an alternative analytical approach for the 
sensitive detection of drugs of abuse in real urine samples.Key pointsThe 
dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was involved for the 
determination of drugs in urine with capillary electrophoresis with photodiode 
array detection (CE-PDA).Good linearity, sensitivity, recovery and precision 
were achieved.The proposed method was eco-friendly with microliter scale solvent 
consumption.

We describe an LC-MS/MS method for serum testosterone using a novel extraction 
media, AC Extraction Plate™ (AC Plate,Tecan Schweiz). The AC Plate principle is 
essentially that of a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) but employs a stationary 
nonpolar phase coated on the wells of 96-well plates instead of a nonmiscible 
organic solvent for partitioning testosterone out of serum, leaving interfering 
substances behind. This low complexity sample preparation protocol has been 
validated for and used in production in our laboratory with both manual and 
automated liquid handling. The primary advantage of this method is the highly 
reproducible nature of an extraction method that does not require LC-MS/MS 
expertise or specialized extraction equipment. We modified the existing vendor 
application and validated the method for matrix effect, recovery, precision, 
trueness [accuracy relative to certified reference material (CRM)], specificity, 
reportable range, sample stability, various sample containers, and correlation 
with other methods.Method performance is excellent, with a reportable range of 
4-750 ng/dL, between-day quality control coefficient of variation (CV) over 
12 months of <8%, mean accuracy of <4.0% bias against CRM, no interference from 
hemolysis, icterus, lipemia, serum separator tube gel, or common 
steroids/metabolites, and mean bias of 1.3% versus 4 other LC-MS/MS testosterone 
methods. An investigation of calibration stability and robustness supports 
sparse (3 versus 6 calibrators) and/or historical calibration for routine use.

The transcription-translation negative feedback loops underlying animal and 
fungal circadian clocks are remarkably similar in their molecular regulatory 
architecture and, although much is understood about their central mechanism, 
little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of the gene products involved. 
A common feature of these circadian oscillators is a significant temporal delay 
between rhythmic accumulation of clock messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding negative 
arm proteins, for example, frq in Neurospora and Per1-3 in mammals, and the 
appearance of the clock protein complexes assembled from the proteins they 
encode. Here, we report use of single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (smFISH) to show that the fraction of nuclei actively transcribing 
the clock gene frq changes in a circadian manner, and that these mRNAs cycle in 
abundance with fewer than five transcripts per nucleus at any time. Spatial 
point patterning statistics reveal that frq is spatially clustered near nuclei 
in a time of day-dependent manner and that clustering requires an RNA-binding 
protein, PRD-2 (PERIOD-2), recently shown also to bind to mRNA encoding another 
core clock component, casein kinase 1. An intrinsically disordered protein, 
PRD-2 displays behavior in vivo and in vitro consistent with participation in 
biomolecular condensates. These data are consistent with a role for 
phase-separating RNA-binding proteins in spatiotemporally organizing clock mRNAs 
to facilitate local translation and assembly of clock protein complexes.

A novel method for the determination of ultra-trace cobalt by dispersive 
liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) coupled with graphite furnace atomic 
absorption spectrometry has been developed. It is based on the color reaction of 
Co2+ with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-dimethylaminoaniline (5-Br-PADMA) in a 
Britton-Robinson buffer solution at pH 6.0 to form stable hydrophobic chelates, 
which were separated and enriched by DLLME with 1,2-dichloroethane (CH2ClCH2Cl) 
as extraction and acetonitrile (CH3CN) as a dispersive solvent. The sedimented 
phase containing the chelates is then determined with GFAAS. Parameters that 
affect extraction efficiency, such as types and volumes of extraction and 
disperser solvents, pH of sample solution, extraction time, concentration of the 
chelating agent 5-Br-PADMA, and salt effect, were investigated. Under optimal 
conditions, the calibration graph was linear over the range 0.05-1.0 ng/mL, with 
a correlation coefficient of 0.9922 and a detection limit of 0.03 ng/mL. 
Preconcentration factor (PF) is calculated as the ratio of the aqueous solution 
volume (5 mL) to that of the organic phase volume (40 μL), and enrichment factor 
(EF) is calculated as the ratio of the slopes of the calibration graphs obtained 
with and without DLLME for 5.0 mL of sample solution, which were 120 and 112.5, 
respectively. The extraction efficiency, calculated by EF/PF·100, was 93.8%. The 
relative standard deviation (RSD) at the 0.5 ng/mL Co2+ level was 3.8% (n = 6). 
The method has been applied to the determination of trace cobalt in water 
samples with satisfactory results.

The novel hydrophobic cobalt anion-based benzyl-functionalized magnetic ionic 
liquid (MIL) was first designed, synthesized, and employed as a multifunctional 
extractant (for extraction, visual observation, and magnetic separation) for 
fast dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction of fluoroquinolones (FQs). 
According to the aromatic structure of FQs, three benzyl-functionalized MILs 
were customized by introducing various aromatic functional groups (benzyl, 
paracetyl phenyl, and m-methoxyphenyl) to justify the extraction efficiency and 
selectivity. In particular, the paracetyl phenyl functionalized MIL showed 
superior extraction efficiency among others due to its hydrophobicity and strong 
interactions of hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. Moreover, under optimal 
conditions, the limits of detection were as low as 0.47-0.56 μg/L, and the 
enhancement factors were as high as 88-95. The recoveries were between 90.8 % 
and 107.8 %, and the relative standard deviation was less than 5.4 %. Ascribed 
to these outstanding experimental results, the benzyl-functionalized MIL is a 
potential magnetic extractant for detecting trace FQs in food samples.

U, Sr, Pb, Nd, and Hf isotope ratios can provide basic and important information 
of nuclear materials. We established a simple and efficient column chemistry 
method using nano-NaBiO3, as both oxidizer and adsorbent, to completely separate 
Ce from rare earth elements (REEs). This new method exhibited a high 
decontamination (Ce/Nd < 10-5) ability and was easy to conducted, thereby 
providing clear advantages compared to traditional liquid-liquid and solid phase 
micro-extraction techniques. Additionally, a rapid four-column separation 
procedure, based on Sr, TUR, Ln resins and nano-NaBiO3, was developed to isolate 
U, Sr, Pb, Nd, and Hf in ore samples. The entire procedure could be completed in 
4-5 hrs. The robustness of the proposed method was demonstrated by analyzing the 
235U/238U, 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 142Nd/144Nd, 
143Nd/144Nd, and 176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratios of two certified reference 
materials (CRMs). The analytical results obtained using this method showed good 
agreement with previously published data. The feasibility of this method was 
extended to the determination of isotope ratios in uranium ores. The results 
obtained from the two samples with different regions indicated that they have 
different isotopic ratios information. These findings indicate the potential for 
the use of this new method in nuclear forensic science.

The field of stress granules (SGs) has recently emerged in the study of the 
plant stress response, yet these structures, their dynamics and importance 
remain poorly characterized. There is currently a gap in our understanding of 
the physiological function of SGs during stress. Since there are only a few 
studies addressing SGs in planta, which are primarily focused on cytoplasmic 
SGs. The recent observation of SG-like foci in the chloroplast (cpSGs) of 
Arabidopsis thaliana opened even more questions regarding the role of these 
subcellular features. In this opinion article, we review the current knowledge 
of cpSGs and propose a workflow for the joint use of the long-established model 
organisms Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and A. thaliana to accelerate the evaluation 
of individual plant cpSGs components and their impact on stress responses. 
Finally, we present a short outlook and what we believe are the significant gaps 
that need to be addressed in the following years.

The flexible and reversible preparation of columns for use in high-performance 
solid phase extraction chromatography by physisorption of organophosphorus acid 
extractants has been investigated in detail. Two extractants have been 
evaluated, bis (2-ethyl-1-hexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) and 2-ethyl-1-hexyl 
(2-ethyl-1-hexyl) phosphonic acid (HEHEHP), but the developed procedure should 
be broadly applicable to other extractants. The liquid-liquid solubility of the 
extractants in feed solvents consisting of aqueous ethanol solutions of varying 
composition has been determined. The total amount of adsorbed extractant has 
been quantified by complete desorption and elution with ethanol followed by 
acid-base titrimetry. Column impregnation with feed solutions of varying 
concentration in the undersaturated region has been systematically evaluated, 
and the influence of a subsequent water wash step has been explored. It is shown 
that to achieve a robust and reproducible physisorption, the adsorbed amount of 
extractant should be determined after the wash step, and care must be taken when 
using indirect methods of measurement. Equilibrium Langmuir-type adsorption 
isotherms as a function of the extractant concentration in the feed solution 
have been determined. Adsorption of HEHEHP is higher than HDEHP for equal feed 
compositions, but the solubility of HEHEHP is lower, resulting in approximately 
identical maximum coverage levels. The ability of the resulting columns to 
separate rare earth elements have been verified for a mixture of eight metals 
using a combined isocratic and gradient elution of nitric acid.

Reusable Extractant and Direct Catalytic Mediation of 
Water/Oil/Chlorodifluoromethane Nano-Emulsion in Natural Gas Condensate for 
Efficient Conversion of Chloride Impurities Into the Dicopper Chloride 
Trihydroxide Nanoparticles.

This research introduces an oil-in-water (O/W) nano-emulsion (oil-water- CHClF2 
) as the reusable extractant phase using liquid-liquid extraction methodology 
for the removal efficiency of Cl- and Hg(0) [between 90% and ∼100%, deepening on 
the nature of the natural gas condensate (NGC)] at a brief separation time 
(<3.0 min). The achieved safety of the NGC using this nano-emulsion results in 
efficient reduction in the corrosion rate during testing iron-based fragments 
(vs. the untreated ones as controls) and increase in the NGC economic value. 
Another advantage of the synthesized nano-emulsion is its capability and 
catalytic mediating behavior to efficiently separate and synthesize highly pure 
dicopper chloride trihydroxide nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were 
characterized by different analytical methods such as Fourier transform infrared 
spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, and direct 
visualization by some electron microscopies. Direct synthesis, fast synthetic 
time (<3.0 min), high purity (>99%), and scalability are the main advantages of 
this synthetic method. This nanoparticle is not only safe but also is 
efficiently applicable in different industries, especially as an eco-friendly 
agricultural pesticide for different plants and tress such as pistachio. 
Consequently, this method is accepted as direct, simple, low-cost, and scalable 
conversion of some upstream industries with the downstream ones. All these 
possibilities are attributed to the intermediate transport properties of the 
introduced O/W nano-emulsion. At this condition, this reagent plays role as a 
recycled motor for the NGC purification and conversion of these impurities into 
the safe and usable products. To the best of knowledge, this research is 
considered as the first report that shows application of this O/W medium for 
both chloride and mercury removal from the NGC and its direct use as top element 
in the synthesis of eco-friendly nanoparticles. This system is applicable in 
some parts of the fuel and oil centers of the "Middle East."

Rapid and reliable detection and quantification of pesticide residues in complex 
matrices by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) remain challenging due to 
the low level of target molecules and the interference of nontarget components. 
In this study, SERS was combined with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction 
(DLLME) to develop a rapid and reliable method for the detection of 
organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs). In this method, DLLME was used to extract 
and enrich two representative OPPs (triazophos and parathion-methyl) from a 
liquid sample, and a portable Raman spectrometer was used to analyze the 
separated sediment using homemade gold nanoparticles colloids as enhancing 
substrates. The results showed that the developed method displayed good 
sensitivity and stability for the detection and quantification of triazophos and 
parathion-methyl with R2 ≥ 0.98. The calculated limits of detection (LODs) in 
the simultaneous detection of triazophos and parathion-methyl were 2.17 × 10-9 M 
(0.679 ppb) and 2.28 × 10-8 M (5.998 ppb), and the calculated limits of 
quantification (LOQs) were 7.23 × 10-9 M (2.26 ppb) and 7.62 × 10-8 M (19.098 
ppb), respectively. Furthermore, the developed SERS method was successfully 
applied to the detection of triazophos and parathion-methyl in apple juice with 
recoveries between 78.07% and 110.87% and relative standard deviations (RSDs) ≤ 
2.06%. Therefore, the developed DLLME facilitated liquid SERS method exhibited 
good sensitivity and stability for the rapid detection and quantification of 
OPPs and had the potential to be applied to the rapid detection of OPPs in 
complex matrices.

Cannabinoid is the most frequently reported illicit drug class in Driving Under 
the Influence of Drugs (DUID) investigation casework. In recent years, our 
laboratory observed an increasing rate of overlapping peaks for the cannabinoid 
confirmation performed using 2D high-performance liquid chromatography 
(LC)--tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS). Starting in early 2018, the incidence of 
unresolved interfering substances increased, contributing to a higher rate of 
canceled testing that peaked at 3.7% in February 2019. The observed interference 
demonstrates a distinctive pattern affecting the identification and 
quantification of both delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and delta-9 carboxy 
THC. An improved quantitative method was developed and validated to separate 
delta-8 and -9 isomers and their metabolites in blood. All acceptance criteria 
were met, with identical measurement ranges from the original method (lower 
limit of quantitation: 0.5 ng/mL for delta-9 THC, 1.0 ng/mL for 11-hydroxy 
delta-9 THC and 5.0 ng/mL for delta-9 carboxy THC). Cannabinoids were extracted 
from whole blood using liquid-liquid extraction, separated in a 2D LC system 
over a run time of 10 min and detected by an MS-MS system equipped with ESI 
source operating in positive ionization mode with scheduled multiple reaction 
mass spectrometric monitoring. The LC system consisted of a pair of Phenomenex® 
SecurityGuard™ C6 Phenyl (4 × 2 mm) cartridges for extracting the compounds with 
5 mM ammonium formate buffer in deionized (DI) water and 0.1% formic acid in 
methanol as mobile phase, and a Phenomenex® Kinetex C18 column (100 × 3 mm) with 
0.1% formic acid in DI water and 0.1% formic acid in methanol for LC separation 
at 45°C. Each set of isomers was fully resolved by the longer run-time method. 
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a method that 
successfully quantitates these primary cannabinoids in blood specimens where 
significant concentrations of both delta-9 and delta-8 isomers are present.

A simple, rapid, and sensitive technique for measuring mirtazapine and its 
metabolites enantiomers in human fluids, such as urine and serum, was developed 
by applying ultrasound-enhanced and surfactant-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid 
microextraction (USA-DLLME) integrated with poly(diallyldimethylammonium 
chloride) (PDDAC)-mediated stacking in capillary electrophoresis (CE). The 
parameters that affect extraction and stacking performance, such as the 
extraction volume, surfactant types, surfactant concentrations, salt additives, 
extraction time, solution pH, and background electrolytes, were comprehensively 
studied and optimized to achieve optimal detection performance. Under optimal 
extraction conditions (injection of 120 µL of C2H2Cl4 into 1 mL of a sample 
solution containing 0.05 mM Brij-35 at pH 10.0) and separation conditions (0.9% 
PDDAC, 10 mM phosphate, pH 3.0, and 20 mM dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin), on-line CE 
stacking of mirtazapine-related chiral drugs was achieved by the two strategies: 
(i) neutral DM-β-CD sweep low concentrations of DL-NaSSA and (ii) DL-NASSA is 
stacked by the difference in the viscosity between the PDDAC and sample zone. An 
approximately 2,800-4000-fold improvement in detection sensitivity was revealed 
for mirtazapine, N-demethylmirtazapine, and 8-hydroxymirtazapine enantiomers. 
The linear ranges for the quantification of all analyte enantiomers were 
1.2-150 nM, with a coefficient of determination higher than 0.99; the relative 
standard deviations in the migration time and peak areas for six analytes were 
less than 1.8% and 5.8%, respectively. The proposed system provided the limits 
of detection (signal-to-noise ratio of 3) of the six analytes as 0.3-0.5 nM. The 
recovery of the six separated analytes spiked in urine and serum samples was 
revealed to be 82.7%-109.5% and 91%-112.8%, respectively. This advanced 
technique with high sensitivity enhancement factors was successfully employed to 
analyze mirtazapine and its metabolites enantiomers in urine and serum samples 
with reliability.

Mitotane is a cytotoxic drug used in the treatment of inoperable adrenocortical 
carcinoma, it inhibits steroidogenesis as well, and therefore monitoring the 
level of steroid hormones in patients treated with mitotane is a crucial point 
of therapy. Hence, we have developed a simple, fast, and efficient 
electrophoretic method combined with reverse polarity sweeping as online 
preconcentration technique and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for the 
simultaneous determination of mitotane, its main metabolite DDA, and five 
steroid hormones (progesterone, testosterone, epitestosterone, cortisol, and 
corticosterone) in urine samples. In addition, a new sample matrix consisting of 
β-CD2 SDS1 complexes for a high hydrophobic compounds solubilization was 
developed. Approach based on the application of β-cyclodextrin and SDS complex 
of a ratio 2:1 allowed for hydrodynamic injection into the capillary of a 
solution containing both mitotane and other analytes. The detection limits of 
the analytes for the reverse polarity sweeping-dispersive liquid-liquid 
microextraction method were found to be in the range of 1.5-3 ng/mL, which were 
approximately 1000 times lower than in the conventional hydrodynamic injection 
(5 s, 0.5 psi) without any preconcentration procedure. All analytes were 
completely resolved in less than 13 min by uncoated silica capillary with an 
inner diameter of 75 μm (ID) × 60 cm. Electrophoretic separation was performed 
in reverse polarity with a voltage of -25 kV with a background electrolyte (BGE) 
consisting of 100 mM SDS, 25% ACN, 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5), and 7 
mM β-cyclodextrin.

Nst1, Densely Associated to P-Body in the Post-Exponential Phases of

Membrane-less biomolecular compartmentalization is a core phenomenon involved in 
many physiological activities that occur ubiquitously in cells. Condensates, 
such as promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, stress granules, and P-bodies 
(PBs), have been investigated to understand the process of membrane-less 
cellular compartmentalization. In budding yeast, PBs dispersed in the cytoplasm 
of exponentially growing cells rapidly accumulate in response to various 
stresses such as osmotic stress, glucose deficiency, and heat stress. In 
addition, cells start to accumulate PBs chronically in post-exponential phases. 
Specific protein-protein interactions are involved in accelerating PB 
accumulation in each circumstance, and discovering the regulatory mechanism for 
each is the key to understanding cellular condensation. Here, we demonstrate 
that Nst1 of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is far more densely 
associated with PBs in post-exponentially growing phases from the diauxic shift 
to the stationary phase than during glucose deprivation of exponentially growing 
cells, while the PB marker Dcp2 exhibits a similar degree of condensation under 
these conditions. Similar to Edc3, ectopic Nst1 overexpression induces 
self-condensation and the condensation of other PB components, such as Dcp2 and 
Dhh1, which exhibit liquid-like properties. Altogether, these results suggest 
that Nst1 has the intrinsic potential for self-condensation and the condensation 
of other PB components, specifically in post-exponential phases.

Atropine is a racemic mixture of d- and l-hyoscyamine, but only l-hyoscyamine is 
the effective ingredient. In this study, a new, sensitive, stable, and selective 
LC/MS assay was developed for the determination of l-hyoscyamine and applied to 
a clinical study. The parent-product (m/z) transition pair of l-hyoscyamine was 
290.1 → 124.1. Chromatographic separations were performed using a chiral MZ 
column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5.0 μm) by a stepwise gradient elution mode with 
n-hexane, isopropanol, and diethylamine as mobile phases. l-Hyoscyamine in human 
plasma was extracted by liquid-liquid extraction. This assay displayed a good 
linearity over a concentration range of 20.0-400 pg/mL for l-hyoscyamine. The 
accuracy of the validation assay for l-hyoscyamine ranged from -2.7% to 4.5%, 
and the precision was within 6.3% coefficient of variation. l-Hyoscyamine in 
human plasma remained stable at different storage conditions. The method has 
been successfully applied to plasma samples obtained from a safety study in 
humans.

Recombinant expression of proteins destined to form biological materials often 
results in poor production yields or loss of their function due to premature 
aggregation. Recently, liquid-liquid phase separation has been proposed as a 
mechanism to control protein solubility during expression and accumulation in 
the cytoplasm. Here, we investigate this process in vivo during the recombinant 
overexpression of the mimetic spider silk mini-spidroin NT2RepCT in Escherichia 
coli. The protein forms intracellular liquid-like condensates that shift to a 
solid-like state triggered by a decrease in their microenvironmental pH. These 
features are also maintained in the purified sample in vitro both in the 
presence of a molecular crowding agent mimicking the bacterial intracellular 
environment, and during a biomimetic extrusion process leading to fiber 
formation. Overall, we demonstrate that characterization of protein condensates 
inside E. coli could be used as a basis for selecting proteins for both 
materials applications and their fundamental structure-function studies.

Some alcoholic modifier gases were applied to separate isomer peaks in ion 
mobility spectrometry (IMS). Different mechanisms have been investigated on the 
separation, such as collision cross-section and analyte-modifier cluster 
formation. In this regard, some parameters that affected the cluster formation, 
such as dipole moment, electron affinity, the position of functional groups, and 
the modifier structure, were evaluated. On the other hand, some effective 
experimental parameters, including cell temperature and the flow rates of the 
drift and modifier gases, were also optimized. The combination of dispersive 
liquid-liquid microextraction with thin-film evaporation (DLLME-TFE) was used as 
a sample preparation method for the extraction of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) 
and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT) isomers (as the target analytes). Isobutanol 
was selected as the alcoholic modifier to separate the ion molecular peaks of 
these isomers. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification obtained 
were 15 and 50 μg L-1 , and the linear dynamic range (50-700 μg L-1 ) with 
coefficient of determination of 0.9941 and 0.9914 were obtained for 2,4-DNT and 
2,6-DNT, respectively. The intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations 
were obtained between 3% and 5%. For validation of the method, determination of 
the isomers was accomplished for a red wastewater field sample, resulting in 
relative recovery values of about 96%.

The recent development of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HDESs) has led to 
growing interest in these reagents as possible environmentally benign 
replacements for conventional organic media in a host of applications, among 
them metal ion separations by liquid-liquid extraction. To evaluate the 
potential utility of these novel solvents in this application, a systematic 
examination of the facilitated transfer of selected alkali and alkaline earth 
cations into representative HDESs from aqueous solution in the presence of a 
macrocyclic polyether (i.e., a crown ether) has been undertaken. Comparison of 
the results to those obtained for a series of oxygenated, aliphatic solvents 
(n-alcohols) and for several 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids 
(ILs) under the same conditions indicate that despite frequent suggestions that 
some HDESs resemble ILs, metal ion distribution in HDES-aqueous systems more 
closely mimics that seen for the alcohols. Metal ion partitioning in these 
systems appears less dependent on the water content of the organic phase and on 
structural variations in the solvent than is the case for either alcohols or 
ionic liquids, however. The implications of these results for the design and 
application of HDES-based extraction systems for metal ions are described.

Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) and countercurrent chromatography 
(CCC) are two preparative techniques mainly used for the isolation and 
purification of natural products. While CPC benefits from a larger sample 
capacity, CCC typically provides better peak resolutions and hereby higher 
purities. In this study, we aimed to combine both advantages by the direct 
linking of CPC and CCC which was achieved by installation of switching valves 
and connection tube. The hyphenated CPC-CCC setup was tested with major 
alkylresorcinols which were obtained from a transesterified and hydrogenated rye 
extract. Injections of 1- and 5-g samples into the individual CCC system 
confirmed the limited sample capacity because of immediate flooding with the 5-g 
sample (total loss of stationary phase). In comparison, the CPC system was 
stable with 5- and 10-g samples but the peak resolution with 1-g sample was 
poorer than with the CCC system. Injections of 5- and 10-g samples into the 
CPC-CCC system were successful. However, a sample load of 10 g resulted in lower 
purities of the alkylresorcinols (80% or less) due to peak tailing. By contrast, 
injection of 5-g sample provided high amounts of ~ 1.2 g alkylresorcinols with 
purities of > 95%.

In eukaryotic cells, biological activities are executed in distinct cellular 
compartments or organelles. Canonical organelles with membrane-bound structures 
are well understood. Cells also inherently contain versatile membrane-less 
organelles (MLOs) that feature liquid or gel-like bodies. A biophysical process 
termed liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) elucidates how MLOs form through 
dynamic biomolecule assembly. LLPS-related molecules often have multivalency, 
which is essential for low-affinity inter- or intra-molecule interactions to 
trigger phase separation. Accumulating evidence shows that LLPS concentrates and 
organizes desired molecules or segregates unneeded molecules in cells. Thus, 
MLOs have tunable functional specificity in response to environmental stimuli 
and metabolic processes. Aberrant LLPS is widely associated with several 
hallmarks of cancer, including sustained proliferative signaling, growth 
suppressor evasion, cell death resistance, telomere maintenance, DNA damage 
repair, etc. Insights into the molecular mechanisms of LLPS provide new insights 
into cancer therapeutics. Here, the current understanding of the emerging 
concepts of LLPS and its involvement in cancer are comprehensively reviewed.

Remnants of the Balbiani body are required for formation of RNA transport 
granules in Xenopus oocytes.

Dame, IN 46556, USA.

The Balbiani body (Bb), an organelle comprised of mitochondria, ER, and RNA, is 
found in the oocytes of most organisms. In Xenopus, the structure is initially 
positioned immediately adjacent to the nucleus, extends toward the vegetal pole, 
and eventually disperses, leaving behind a region highly enriched in 
mitochondria. This area is later transversed by RNP complexes that are being 
localized to the vegetal cortex. Inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis 
prevents perinuclear formation of the transport complexes that can be reversed 
by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, indicating the nucleotide is acting as a 
hydrotrope. The protein composition, sensitivity to hexanediol, and coalescence 
in the absence of transport provide evidence that the transport RNP complexes 
are biocondensates. The breakdown of the Bb engenders regions of clustered 
mitochondria that are used not to meet extraordinary energy demands, but rather 
to promote a liquid-liquid phase separation.

Unusual Correlation between the Apparent Amorphous Solubility of a Drug and 
Solubilizer Concentration Revealed by NMR Analysis.

Herein, we investigated the effect of the solubilizers, cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB) and amino methacrylate copolymer (Eudragit E PO, EUD-E), on the 
apparent amorphous solubility of ketoprofen (KTP) and free KTP concentrations in 
an aqueous phase when a KTP-rich phase was generated by liquid-liquid phase 
separation. Quantitative analysis by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
revealed that the apparent amorphous solubility of KTP increased with increasing 
EUD-E concentrations by the solubilization of KTP into the EUD-E micelles; this 
was reminiscent of the improvement in the apparent crystalline solubility of KTP 
observed when EUD-E was added. In contrast, the apparent amorphous solubility of 
KTP decreased with increasing CTAB concentrations, although the solubilizing 
ability of CTAB was stronger than that of EUD-E when the KTP-rich phase was 
absent. NMR analysis revealed that CTAB was distributed into the KTP-rich phase 
to a relatively large extent. This resulted in a significant reduction of the 
chemical potential of KTP in the KTP-rich phase in the CTAB solution. Thus, the 
maximum free KTP concentration in the aqueous phase was reduced more 
significantly in the CTAB solution than in the EUD-E solution. Moreover, the 
solubilization effect of KTP by the CTAB micelles in the aqueous phase was 
drastically diminished due to the distribution of CTAB into the KTP-rich phase. 
As a result, the apparent amorphous solubility of KTP reached a minimum at a 
CTAB concentration of 200 μg/mL. A further increase in the CTAB concentration 
resulted in an improvement in the apparent amorphous solubility of KTP due to 
the solubilization effect of CTAB remaining in the aqueous phase. The present 
study highlights the impact of solubilizer selection on the apparent amorphous 
solubility and attainable supersaturation of the drug, which should be 
considered during the development of supersaturating formulations to obtain 
preferable oral absorption.

The emergence of biomolecular condensation and liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) introduces a new layer of complexity into our understanding of cell and 
molecular biology. Evidence steadily grows indicating that condensates are not 
only implicated in physiology but also human disease. Macro- and mesoscale 
characterization of condensates as a whole have been instrumental in 
understanding their biological functions and dysfunctions. By contrast, the 
molecular level characterization of condensates and how condensates modify the 
properties of the molecules that constitute them thus far remain comparably 
scarce. In this minireview we summarize and discuss the findings of several 
recent studies that have focused on structure, dynamics, and interactions of 
proteins undergoing condensation. The mechanistic insights they provide help us 
identify the relevant properties nature and scientists can leverage to modulate 
the behavior of condensate systems. We also discuss the unique environment of 
the droplet surface and speculate on effects of topological constraints and 
physical exclusion on condensate properties.

Lipid Homeostasis and Its Links With Protein Misfolding Diseases.

The maintenance of lipid homeostasis is essential for the normal functioning of 
living organisms. Alterations of the lipid homeostasis system remodel the 
composition of the lipidome, potentially leading to the formation of toxic lipid 
species. In turn, lipidome changes can affect the protein homeostasis system by 
causing perturbations that elicit protein condensation phenomena such as protein 
liquid-liquid phase separation and protein aggregation. Lipids can also be more 
directly involved the formation of aberrant condensed states of proteins by 
facilitating the early events that initiate these processes and by stabilizing 
the condensed states themselves. These observations suggest that lipid-induced 
toxicity can contribute to protein misfolding diseases, including Alzheimer's 
and Parkinson's diseases. According to this view, an impairment of the lipid 
homeostasis system generates toxic states of lipids that disturb the protein 
homeostasis system and promote the formation of toxic states of proteins.

Traditionally, complex coacervation is regarded as a process whereby two 
oppositely charged polyelectrolytes self-assemble into spherical droplets. Here, 
we introduce the polyzwitterionic complex, "pZC", formed by the liquid-liquid 
phase separation of a polyzwitterion and a polyelectrolyte, and elucidate a 
mechanism by which such complexes can assemble using theory and experimental 
evidence. This system exhibits orthogonal phase behavior-it remains intact in 
acidic conditions, but disassembles as the pH increases, a process governed by 
the acid-base equilibria of the constituent chains. We relate the observed phase 
behavior to physiological conditions within the gastrointestinal tract with a 
simulation of the gastroduodenal junction, and demonstrate using video 
microscopy the viability of polyzwitterionic coacervates as technologies for the 
pH-triggered release of cargo. Such a system is envisaged to tackle imminent 
problems of drug transport via the oral route and serve as a packaging solution 
to increase uptake efficiency.

Oncoprotein SS18-SSX is a hallmark of synovial sarcomas. However, as a part of 
the SS18-SSX fusion protein, SS18's function remains unclear. Here, we depict 
the structures of both human SS18/BRG1 and yeast SNF11/SNF2 subcomplexes. Both 
subcomplexes assemble into heterodimers that share a similar conformation, 
suggesting that SNF11 might be a homologue of SS18 in chromatin remodeling 
complexes. Importantly, our study shows that the self-association of the 
intrinsically disordered region, QPGY domain, leads to liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) of SS18 or SS18-SSX and the subsequent recruitment of BRG1 
into phase-separated condensates. Moreover, our results show that the tyrosine 
residues in the QPGY domain play a decisive role in the LLPS of SS18 or 
SS18-SSX. Perturbations of either SS18-SSX LLPS or SS18-SSX's binding to BRG1 
impair NIH3T3 cell transformation by SS18-SSX. Our data demonstrate that both 
LLPS and assembling into chromatin remodelers contribute to the oncogenic 
activity of SS18-SSX in synovial sarcomas.

Analytical Formulation and Field-Theoretic Simulation of Sequence-Specific Phase 
Separation of Protein-Like Heteropolymers with Short- and Long-Spatial-Range

A theory for sequence-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of 
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) in the study of biomolecular 
condensates is formulated by extending the random phase approximation (RPA) and 
field-theoretic simulation (FTS) of heteropolymers with spatially long-range 
Coulomb interactions to include the fundamental effects of short-range, 
hydrophobic-like interactions between amino acid residues. To this end, 
short-range effects are modeled by Yukawa interactions between multiple 
nonelectrostatic charges derived from an eigenvalue decomposition of pairwise 
residue-residue contact energies. Chain excluded volume is afforded by 
incompressibility constraints. A mean-field approximation leads to an effective 
Flory-Huggins χ parameter, which, in conjunction with RPA, accounts for the 
contact-interaction effects of amino acid composition and the sequence-pattern 
effects of long-range electrostatics in IDP LLPS, whereas FTS based on the 
formulation provides full sequence dependence for both short- and long-range 
interactions. This general approach is illustrated here by applications to 
variants of a natural IDP in the context of several different amino-acid 
interaction schemes as well as a set of different model hydrophobic-polar 
sequences sharing the same composition. Effectiveness of the methodology is 
verified by coarse-grained explicit-chain molecular dynamics simulations.

The application of oligonucleotides as drugs for different genetic diseases is 
increasing rapidly. Since 2016 they are used during spinal muscular atrophy 
treatment with the use of nusinersen oligonucleotide. The purpose of this study 
was to improve methods for the analysis of serum samples of patients treated 
with nusinersen. The results showed that liquid-liquid extraction (with 
phenol/chloroform) is insufficient and an additional purification step using 
solid-phase extraction is necessary. The best results were obtained for 
microextraction by packed sorbents. Important parameters in the optimization of 
the method were mainly the type of amine in the mobile phase and the stationary 
phase. Both influenced the selectivity of metabolite separation and thus their 
correct identification; while amine type impacted also the intensity of signals. 
Finally, the highest resolution of separation and the highest peak areas were 
obtained for N,N-dimethylbutylamine or N,N-diisopropylthylamine with an 
octadecyl column with a terminal aryl group. Over a dozen of metabolites were 
successfully identified with the use of methods developed during the study. The 
3' exonucleases and 5' exonucleases were mainly responsible for nusinersen 
metabolism, consequently, 3'end shortmers, and 5'end shortmers were observed, as 
well as metabolites with simultaneous loss of bases at both ends of the 
sequence. However, some depurination and depyrimidination products were also 
identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on nusinersen 
and its metabolite identification in serum samples by liquid chromatography and 
mass spectrometry.

Biomolecular condensation of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein Tau 
(MAPT) can be induced by coacervation with polyanions like RNA, or by molecular 
crowding. Tau condensates have been linked to both functional microtubule 
binding and pathological aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases. We find that 
molecular crowding and coacervation with RNA, two conditions likely coexisting 
in the cytosol, synergize to enable Tau condensation at physiological buffer 
conditions and to produce condensates with a strong affinity to charged 
surfaces. During condensate-mediated microtubule polymerization, their synergy 
enhances bundling and spatial arrangement of microtubules. We further show that 
different Tau condensates efficiently induce pathological Tau aggregates in 
cells, including accumulations at the nuclear envelope that correlate with 
nucleocytoplasmic transport deficits. Fluorescent lifetime imaging reveals 
different molecular packing densities of Tau in cellular accumulations and a 
condensate-like density for nuclear-envelope Tau. These findings suggest that a 
complex interplay between interaction partners, post-translational 
modifications, and molecular crowding regulates the formation and function of 
Tau condensates. Conditions leading to prolonged existence of Tau condensates 
may induce the formation of seeding-competent Tau and lead to distinct cellular 
Tau accumulations.

In recent years, there has been an increase in research efforts surrounding RNA 
modification thanks to key breakthroughs in NGS-based whole transcriptome 
mapping methods. More than 100 modifications have been reported in RNAs, and 
some have been mapped at single-nucleotide resolution in the mammalian 
transcriptome. This has opened new research avenues in fields such as 
neurobiology, developmental biology, and oncology, among others. To date, we 
know that the RNA modification machinery finely tunes many diverse mechanisms 
involved in RNA processing and translation to regulate gene expression. However, 
it appears obvious to the research community that we have only just begun the 
process of understanding the several functions of the dynamic web of RNA 
modification, or the "epitranscriptome". To expand the data generated so far, 
recently published studies revealed a dual role for N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 
the most abundant mRNA modification, in driving both chromatin dynamics and 
transcriptional output. These studies showed that the m6A-modified, 
chromatin-associated RNAs could act as molecular docks, recruiting histone 
modification proteins and thus contributing to the regulation of local chromatin 
structure. Here, we review these latest exciting findings and outline 
outstanding research questions whose answers will help to elucidate the 
biological relevance of the m6A modification of chromatin-associated RNAs in 
mammalian cells.

Nuciferine is an important drug candidate for the treatment of many diseases. 
However, there is no general method for its low - cost production. In this work, 
a feasible method for the production of nuciferine from lotus leaf, using 
ultrasonic-assisted extraction-solid phase extraction (UAE-SPE) as extraction 
and cleanup procedure, was developed. Petroleum ether and silica gel have been 
successfully used as extraction solvent and adsorbent to integrate UAE with SPE, 
respectively. Except for filtration, no treatment (e.g. concentration and 
redissolution, etc) was needed on UAE extract before SPE and the effluents 
obtained in the loading process of SPE could be used as UAE extraction solvent 
without purification. No obvious decline in the extraction efficiency of UAE and 
adsorption capacity of SPE was observed at least for 5 runs, which provides a 
feasible way for the continuous production of nuciferine in industry, i.e. 
Cyclic UAE-SPE. Moreover, SPE column could be conveniently regenerated and 
reused without significant decline in its adsorption capacity at least for 5 
cycles, which can be used to reduce the cost of the whole system further. In 
comparison with other cleanup procedures, Cyclic UAE-SPE showed apparent 
advantages in energy conservation and emission reduction. LLE and 
crystallization were applied to separate nuciferine from other impurities 
further. Under optimum conditions, the total recovery rate of nuciferine with a 
purity over 90.0% from lotus leaf reached 50.1%. All in all, the developed 
method has advantages in convenient operation, low cost, and high efficiency, 
thus, is fitting for the production of high purity nuciferine.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is an RNA-regulating protein that carries 
out many cellular functions through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The 
LLPS of TDP-43 is mediated by its C-terminal low-complexity domain (TDP43-LCD) 
corresponding to the region 267-414. In neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, pathological inclusions of the 
TDP-43 are found that are rich in the C-terminal fragments of ∼25 and ∼35 kDa, 
of which TDP43-LCD is a part. Thus, understanding the assembly process of 
TDP43-LCD is essential, given its involvement in the formation of both 
functional liquid-like assemblies and solid- or gel-like pathological 
aggregates. Here, we show that the solution pH and salt modulate TDP43-LCD LLPS. 
A gradual reduction in the pH below its isoelectric point of 9.8 results in a 
monotonic decrease of TDP43-LCD LLPS due to charge-charge repulsion between 
monomers, while at pH 6 and below no LLPS was observed. The addition of heparin 
to TDP43-LCD solution at pH 6, at a 1:2 heparin-to-TDP43-LCD molar ratio, 
promotes TDP43-LCD LLPS, while at higher concentration, it disrupts LLPS through 
a reentrant phase transition. Upon incubation at pH 6, TDP43-LCD undergoes 
gelation without phase separation. However, in the reentrant regime in the 
presence of a high heparin concentration, it forms thick amyloid aggregates that 
are significantly more SDS resistant than the gel. The results indicate that the 
material nature of the TDP43-LCD assembly products can be modulated by heparin 
which is significant in the context of liquid-to-solid phase transition observed 
in TDP-43 proteinopathies. Our findings are also crucial in relation to similar 
transitions that could occur due to alteration in the molecular level 
interactions among various multivalent biomolecules involving other LCDs and 
RNAs.

The rapid development of flexible electronics and soft robotics has an urgent 
demand for materials with wide-range switchable stiffness. Here, we report a 
polymer network that can isochorically and reversibly switch between soft 
ionogel and rigid plastic accompanied by a gigantic stiffness change from about 
600 Pa to 85 MPa. This transition is realized by introducing polymer 
vitrification to regulate the liquid-liquid phase separation, namely the 
Berghmans' point in the phase diagram of binary gel systems. Regulating the 
Lewis acid-base interactions between polymer and ionic liquids, the 
stiffness-changing ratio of polymer network can be tuned from 10 to more than 
105. These wide-range stiffness-changing ionogels show excellent shape 
adaptability and reconfigurability, which can enhance the interfacial adhesion 
between ionogel and electrode by an order of magnitude and reduce interfacial 
impedance by 75%.

The Environmental Protection Agency's definition of "Green Chemistry" is "the 
design of chemical products and processes that reduces or eliminates the use or 
generation of hazardous substances. Green chemistry applies across the life 
cycle of a chemical product, including its design, manufacture, use, and 
ultimate disposal." Conventional omic tissue extraction procedures use solvents 
that are toxic and carcinogenic, such as chloroform and methyl-tert-butyl ether 
for lipidomics, or caustic chaotropic solutions for genomics and 
transcriptomics, such as guanidine or urea. A common preservation solution for 
pathology is formaldehyde, which is a carcinogen. Use of acetonitrile as a 
universal biospecimen preservation and extraction solvent will reduce these 
hazardous wastes, because it is less toxic and more environmentally friendly 
than the conventional solvents used in biorepository and biospecimen research. A 
new extraction method never applied to multi-omic, system biology research, 
called cold-induced phase separation (CIPS), uses freezing point temperatures to 
induce a phase separation of acetonitrile-water mixtures. Also, the CO2 exposure 
during CIPS will acidify the water precipitating DNA out of aqueous phase. The 
resulting phase separation brings hydrophobic lipids to the top acetonitrile 
fraction that is easily decanted from the bottom aqueous fraction, especially 
when the water is frozen. This CIPS acetonitrile extract contains the lipidome 
(lipids), the bottom aqueous fraction is sampled to obtain the transcriptome 
(RNA) fraction, and the remaining water and pellet is extracted with 60% 
acetonitrile to isolate the metabolome (<1 kD polar molecules). Finally, steps 4 
and 5 use a TRIzol™ liquid-liquid extraction SOP of the pellet to isolate the 
genome (DNA) and proteome (proteins). This chapter details the multi-omic 
sequential extraction SOP and potential problems associated with each of the 5 
steps, with steps 2, 4, and 5 still requiring validation. The metabolomic and 
lipidomic extraction efficiencies using the CIPS SOP is compared to conventional 
solvent extraction SOPs and is analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), respectively. 
Acetonitrile biospecimen preservation combined with the CIPS multi-omic 
extraction SOP is green chemistry technology that will eliminate the generation 
of the hazardous substances associated with biospecimen processing and permits 
separation and safe disposal of acetonitrile avoiding environmental 
contamination.

The aggregation of proteins into amyloid fibers is linked to more than forty 
still incurable cellular and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's 
disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, 
among others. The process of amyloid formation is a main feature of cell 
degeneration and disease pathogenesis. Despite being methodologically 
challenging, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of aggregation, 
especially in the early stages, is essential to find new biological targets for 
innovative therapies. Here, we reviewed selected examples on α-syn showing how 
complementary approaches, which employ different biophysical techniques and 
models, can better deal with a comprehensive study of amyloid aggregation. In 
addition to the monomer aggregation and conformational transition hypothesis, we 
reported new emerging theories regarding the self-aggregation of α-syn, such as 
the alpha-helix rich tetramer hypothesis, whose destabilization induce monomer 
aggregation; and the liquid-liquid phase separation hypothesis, which considers 
a phase separation of α-syn into liquid droplets as a primary event towards the 
evolution to aggregates. The final aim of this review is to show how multimodal 
methodologies provide a complete portrait of α-syn oligomerization and can be 
successfully extended to other protein aggregation diseases.

Diffusion controls local concentration profiles at interfaces between segregated 
fluid elements during mixing processes. This is important for antisolvent 
crystallization, where it is intuitively argued that local concentration 
profiles at interfaces between solution and antisolvent fluid elements can 
result in significant supersaturation overshoots over and above that at the 
final mixture composition, leading to poorly controlled nucleation. Previous 
work on modeling diffusive mixing in antisolvent crystallization has relied on 
Fickian diffusion, where concentration gradients are the driving force for 
diffusion. This predicts large overshoots in the supersaturation at interfaces 
between solution and antisolvent, as is often intuitively expected. However, 
chemical potential gradients provide a more physically realistic driving force 
for diffusion, and in highly nonideal solutions, such as those in antisolvent 
crystallization, this leads to nonintuitive behavior. In particular, as solute 
diffusion toward antisolvent is severely hindered, it can diffuse against its 
concentration gradient away from antisolvent. We apply thermodynamically 
consistent diffusion model based on the multicomponent Maxwell-Stefan 
formulation to examine diffusive mixing in a nonideal antisolvent 
crystallization system. Large supersaturation overshoots above that at the final 
mixture composition are not found when a thermodynamically consistent approach 
is used, demonstrating that these overshoots are modeling artifacts and are not 
expected to be present in physical systems. In addition, for certain conditions, 
localized liquid-liquid spinodal demixing is predicted to occur during the 
diffusive mixing process, even when the final mixture composition is outside the 
liquid-liquid phase separation region. Intermittent spinodal demixing driven by 
diffusive mixing may provide a novel explanation for differences of nucleation 
behaviors among various antisolvents.

Condensate formation of biopolymer solutions, prominently those of various 
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), is often driven by "sticky" 
interactions between associating residues, multivalently present along the 
polymer backbone. Using a ternary mean-field "stickers-and-spacers" model, we 
demonstrate that if sticker association is of the order of a few times the 
thermal energy, a delicate balance between specific binding and nonspecific 
polymer-solvent interactions gives rise to a particularly rich ternary phase 
behavior under physiological circumstances. For a generic system represented by 
a solution comprising multiassociative scaffold and client polymers, the 
difference in solvent compatibility between the polymers modulates the nature of 
isothermal liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) between associative and 
segregative. The calculations reveal regimes of dualistic phase behavior, where 
both types of LLPS occur within the same phase diagram, either associated with 
the presence of multiple miscibility gaps or a flip in the slope of the 
tie-lines belonging to a single coexistence region.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with 
ubiquitin-positive inclusions are associated with deposition of cytosolic 
inclusion bodies of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in brain and motor 
neurons. We induced phase separation of purified full-length TDP-43 devoid of 
large tags using a solution-jump method, and monitored it with an array of 
biophysical techniques. The tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide- or 
Alexa488-labeled protein formed rapidly (<1 min) apparently round, homogeneous 
and 0.5-1.0 μm wide assemblies, when imaged using confocal fluorescence, 
bright-field, and stimulated emission depletion microscopy. The assemblies, 
however, had limited internal diffusion, as assessed with fluorescence recovery 
after photobleaching, and did not coalesce, but rather clustered into irregular 
bunches, unlike those formed by the C-terminal domain. They were enriched with 
α-helical structure, with minor contributions of β-sheet/random structure, had a 
red-shifted tryptophan fluorescence and did not bind thioflavin T. By monitoring 
with turbidimetry both the formation of the spherical species and their further 
clustering under different experimental conditions, we carried out a 
multiparametric analysis of the two phenomena. In particular, both processes 
were found to be promoted by high protein concentrations, salts, crowding 
agents, weakly by reducing agents, as the pH approached a value of 6.0 from 
either side (corresponding to the TDP-43 isoionic point), and as the temperature 
approached a value of 31°C from either side. Important differences were found 
with respect to the TDP-43 C-terminal domain. Our multiparametric results also 
provide explanations to some of the solubility data obtained on full-length 
TDP-43 that were difficult to explain following the multiparametric analysis 
acquired on the C-terminal domain.

Under conditions of nutrient adversity, bacteria adjust metabolism to minimize 
cellular energy usage. This is often achieved by controlling the synthesis and 
degradation of RNA. In Escherichia coli, RNase E is the central enzyme involved 
in RNA degradation and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the multiprotein 
complex known as the RNA degradosome. The activity of RNase E against specific 
mRNAs can also be regulated by the action of small RNAs (sRNA). In this case, 
the ubiquitous bacterial chaperone Hfq bound to sRNAs can interact with the RNA 
degradosome for the sRNA guided degradation of target RNAs. The RNA degradosome 
and Hfq have never been visualized together in live bacteria. We now show that 
in long-term nitrogen starved E. coli, both RNase E and Hfq co-localize in a 
single, large focus. This subcellular assembly, which we refer to as the H-body, 
forms by a liquid-liquid phase separation type mechanism and includes components 
of the RNA degradosome, namely, the helicase RhlB and the exoribonuclease 
polynucleotide phosphorylase. The results support the existence of a hitherto 
unreported subcellular compartmentalization of a process(s) associated with RNA 
management in stressed bacteria.

Many synaptic proteins form biological condensates via liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS). Synaptopathy, a key feature of autism spectrum disorders 
(ASD), is likely relevant to the impaired phase separation and/or transition of 
ASD-linked synaptic proteins. Here, we report that LLPS and zinc-induced 
liquid-to-gel phase transition regulate the synaptic distribution and 
protein-protein interaction of cortactin-binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2), an 
ASD-linked protein. CTTNBP2 forms self-assembled condensates through its 
C-terminal intrinsically disordered region and facilitates SHANK3 
co-condensation at dendritic spines. Zinc binds the N-terminal coiled-coil 
region of CTTNBP2, promoting higher-order assemblies. Consequently, it leads to 
reduce CTTNBP2 mobility and enhance the stability and synaptic retention of 
CTTNBP2 condensates. Moreover, ASD-linked mutations alter condensate formation 
and synaptic retention of CTTNBP2 and impair mouse social behaviors, which are 
all ameliorated by zinc supplementation. Our study suggests the relevance of 
condensate formation and zinc-induced phase transition to the synaptic 
distribution and function of ASD-linked proteins.

Liquid-liquid phase separation underlies the formation of biological 
condensates. Physically, such systems are microemulsions that in general have a 
propensity to fuse and coalesce; however, many condensates persist as 
independent droplets in the test tube and inside cells. This stability is 
crucial for their function, but the physicochemical mechanisms that control the 
emulsion stability of condensates remain poorly understood. Here, by combining 
single-condensate zeta potential measurements, optical microscopy, tweezer 
experiments, and multiscale molecular modeling, we investigate how the nanoscale 
forces that sustain condensates impact their stability against fusion. By 
comparing peptide-RNA (PR25:PolyU) and proteinaceous (FUS) condensates, we show 
that a higher condensate surface charge correlates with a lower fusion 
propensity. Moreover, measurements of single condensate zeta potentials reveal 
that such systems can constitute classically stable emulsions. Taken together, 
these results highlight the role of passive stabilization mechanisms in 
protecting biomolecular condensates against coalescence.

Fixing cells with paraformaldehyde (PFA) is an essential step in numerous 
biological techniques as it is thought to preserve a snapshot of biomolecular 
transactions in living cells. Fixed cell imaging techniques such as 
immunofluorescence have been widely used to detect liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) in vivo. Here, we compared images, before and after fixation, 
of cells expressing intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to undergo 
LLPS. Surprisingly, we found that PFA fixation can both enhance and diminish 
putative LLPS behaviors. For specific proteins, fixation can even cause their 
droplet-like puncta to artificially appear in cells that do not have any 
detectable puncta in the live condition. Fixing cells in the presence of 
glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse the fixation 
effect from enhancing to diminishing LLPS appearance. We further established a 
kinetic model of fixation in the context of dynamic protein-protein 
interactions. Simulations based on the model suggest that protein localization 
in fixed cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein interaction 
dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and notably, the difference between 
fixation rates of different proteins. Consistent with simulations, live-cell 
single-molecule imaging experiments showed that a fast overall rate of fixation 
relative to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation 
artifacts. Our work reveals that PFA fixation changes the appearance of LLPS 
from living cells, presents a caveat in studying LLPS using fixation-based 
methods, and suggests a mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.

Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic, reversible biomolecular condensates, which 
assemble in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells under various stress conditions. 
Formation of SGs typically occurs upon stress-induced translational arrest and 
polysome disassembly. The increase in cytoplasmic mRNAs triggers the formation 
of a protein-RNA network that undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when a 
critical interaction threshold has been reached. This adaptive stress response 
allows a transient shutdown of several cellular processes until the stress is 
removed. During the recovery from stress, SGs disassemble to re-establish 
cellular activities. Persistent stress and disease-related mutations in SG 
components favor the formation of aberrant SGs that are impaired in disassembly 
and prone to aggregation. Recently, posttranslational modifications of SG 
components have been identified as major regulators of SG dynamics. Here, we 
summarize new insights into the role of ubiquitination in affecting SG dynamics 
and clearance and discuss implications for neurodegenerative diseases linked to 
aberrant SG formation.

The segregation and maintenance of a dedicated germline in multicellular 
organisms is essential for species propagation in the sexually reproducing 
metazoan kingdom. The germline is distinct from somatic cells in that it is 
ultimately dedicated to acquiring the "totipotency" and to regenerating the 
offspring after fertilization. The most striking feature of germ cells lies in 
the presence of characteristic membraneless germ granules that have recently 
proven to behave like liquid droplets resulting from liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS). Vasa/Ddx4, a faithful DEAD-box family germline marker highly 
conserved across metazoan species, harbors canonical DEAD-box motifs and typical 
intrinsically disordered sequences at both the N-terminus and C-terminus. This 
feature enables it to serve as a primary driving force behind germ granule 
formation and helicase-mediated RNA metabolism (e.g., piRNA biogenesis). Genetic 
ablation of Vasa/Ddx4 or the catalytic-dead mutations abolishing its helicase 
activity led to sexually dimorphic germline defects resulting in either male or 
female sterility among diverse species. While recent efforts have discovered 
pivotal functions of Vasa/Ddx4 in somatic cells, especially in multipotent stem 
cells, we herein summarize the helicase-dependent and -independent functions of 
Vasa/Ddx4 in the germline, and discuss recent findings of Vasa/Ddx4-mediated 
phase separation, germ granule formation and piRNA-dependent retrotransposon 
control essential for germline development.

Brown carbon aerosol in the atmosphere contain light-absorbing chromophores that 
influence the optical scattering properties of the particles. These chromophores 
may be hydrophobic, such as PAHs, or water soluble, such as nitroaromatics, 
imidazoles, and other conjugated oxygen-rich molecules. Water-soluble 
chromophores are expected to exist in aqueous solution in the presence of 
sufficient water and will exhibit physical properties (e.g., size, refractive 
index, and phase morphology) that depend on the environmental relative humidity 
(RH). In this work, we characterize the RH-dependent properties of 
4-nitrocatechol (4-NC) and its mixtures with ammonium sulfate, utilizing a 
single-particle levitation platform coupled with Mie resonance spectroscopy to 
probe the size, real part of the complex refractive index (RI), and phase 
morphology of individual micron-sized particles. We measure the hygroscopic 
growth properties of pure 4-NC and apply mixing rules to characterize the growth 
of mixtures with ammonium sulfate. We report the RI at 589 nm for these samples 
as a function of RH and explore the wavelength dependence of the RI at 
non-absorbing wavelengths. The real part of the RI at 589 nm was found to vary 
in the range 1.54-1.59 for pure 4-NC from 92.5 to 75% RH, with an estimated pure 
component RI of 1.70. The real part of the RI was also measured for mixtures of 
AS and 4-NC and ranged from 1.39 to 1.51 depending on the component ratio and 
RH. We went on to characterize phase transitions in mixed particles, identifying 
the onset RH of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and efflorescence 
transitions. Mixtures showed LLPS in the range of 85-76% RH depending on the 
molar ratio, while efflorescence typically fell between 22 and 42% RH. Finally, 
we characterized the imaginary part of the complex RI using an effective 
oscillator model to capture the wavelength-dependent absorption properties of 
the system.

Aberrant DNA damage response (DDR) axis remains the major molecular mechanism 
for tumor radio-resistance. We recently characterized liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) as an essential mechanism of DDR, and identified several key 
DDR factors as potential LLPS proteins, including nucleolar protein NOP53. In 
this study, we found that NOP53 formed highly concentrated droplets in vivo and 
in vitro, which had liquid-like properties including the fusion of adjacent 
condensates, rapid fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and the 
sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol. Moreover, the intrinsically disordered region 1 
(IDR1) is required for NOP53 phase separation. In addition, 
multivalent-arginine-rich linear motifs (M-R motifs), which are enriched in 
NOP53, were essential for its nucleolar localization, but were dispensable for 
the LLPS of NOP53. Functionally, NOP53 silencing diminished tumor cell growth, 
and significantly sensitized colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to radiotherapy. 
Mechanically, NOP53 negatively regulated p53 pathway in CRC cells treated with 
or without radiation. Importantly, data from clinical samples confirmed a 
correlation between NOP53 expression and tumor radio-resistance. Together, these 
results indicate an important role of NOP53 in radio-resistance, and provide a 
potential target for tumor radio-sensitization.

Proteome imbalance can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation which is 
associated with pathologies. Protein aggregation can also be an active, 
organized process and can be exploited by cells as a survival strategy. In 
adverse conditions, it is beneficial to deposit the proteins in a condensate 
rather degrading and resynthesizing. Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are 
biological condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), 
involving cellular components such as nucleic acids and proteins. LLPS is a 
regulated process, which when perturbed, can undergo a transition from a 
physiological liquid condensate to pathological solid-like protein aggregates. 
To understand how the MLO-associated proteins (MLO-APs) behave during aging, we 
performed a comparative meta-analysis with age-related proteome of C. elegans. 
We found that the MLO-APs are highly abundant throughout the lifespan in 
wild-type and long-lived daf-2 mutant animals. Interestingly, they are 
aggregating more in long-lived mutant animals compared to the age matched 
wild-type and short-lived daf-16 and hsf-1 mutant animals. GO term analysis 
revealed that the cell cycle and embryonic development are among the top 
enriched processes in addition to RNP components in aggregated proteome. 
Considering antagonistic pleotropic nature of these developmental genes and post 
mitotic status of C. elegans, we assume that these proteins phase transit during 
post development. As the organism ages, these MLO-APs either mature to become 
more insoluble or dissolve in uncontrolled manner. However, in the long-lived 
daf-2 mutant animals, the MLOs may attain protective states due to extended 
availability and association of molecular chaperones.

Solid nanogenerators often have limited charge transfer due to their low contact 
area. Liquid-liquid nanogenerators can transfer a charge better than the 
solid-solid and solid-liquid counterparts. However, the precise manipulation of 
the liquid morphology remains a challenge because of the fluidity limits of the 
liquid. In this work, using the surface tension of a droplet to fix its shape, a 
liquid-liquid triboelectric nanogenerator in Contact-Separation mode is designed 
using an immiscible aqueous-aqueous interface, achieving a contact surface 
charge transfer of 129 nC for a single droplet. The configuration is proven to 
be applicable in humid environments, and the two-phase materials have good 
biocompatibility and can be used as an effective drug carrier. Therefore, this 
nanogenerator is useful for designing future implantable devices. Meanwhile, 
this design also establishes the foundation of aqueous electronics, and 
additional applications can be achieved using this route.

A rapid, selective and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for quantification of procyclidine 
hydrochloride in human plasma using Procyclidine D11 hydrochloride as internal 
standard. Liquid-liquid extraction technique with methyl tertiary butyl ether 
was used for the extraction of plasma samples. Chromatographic separation of the 
analyte and the internal standard from the endogenous components was done on 
Zodiac C18 column (50 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm) using a mixture of methanol and 0.1% 
formic acid in water (70:30, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min 
with the run time of 2 min. The detection of the eluents was done using multiple 
reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive ion mode. Linearity of the method was 
established in the concentration range of 0.5 to 120 ng/mL. Full validation of 
the method was done as per USFDA guidelines and the results were well within the 
acceptance limits. The successful application of the method was done on healthy 
human subjects under fasting conditions, proving it to be used for 
bioequivalence and bioavailability (BA/BE) studies of procyclidine.

A vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction, based on a natural hydrophobic 
deep eutectic solvent made from the monoterpene thymol and octanoic fatty acid, 
was employed for the analysis of 11 phthalate esters and one adipate in kombucha 
(a tea-based fermented beverage). Separation and determination were performed 
using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to 
a single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Confirmatory analyses were carried out 
through UHPLC tandem mass spectrometry. The full method was validated in terms 
of matrix effect, matrix-matched calibration, sensitivity, recovery, limits of 
detection and quantification and repeatability. Satisfactory determination 
coefficients for quadratic calibration curves (≥0.9938), recovery values 
(67-120%) and limits of detection (0.07-5.45 µg/L) were obtained. Analysis of 26 
kombucha samples reported concentrations for dibutyl phthalate and dimethyl 
phthalate in the range between the limit of quantification (LOQ) and 16.18 ± 
1.14 µg/L, although these phthalates were also detected under the LOQ in some of 
the analyzed samples. Only one of the samples bottled in plastic containers (7) 
did not present residues while only five of the 19 samples in glass bottles 
contained any plasticizer. However, the highest concentration was found in a 
kombucha bottled in food-grade glass. This work represents the first application 
in which phthalates and adipates are analyzed in kombuchas.

Uniformly charged polyelectrolyte molecules disperse uniformly in aqueous 
electrolyte solutions, due to electrostatic repulsion between them. In stark 
contrast to this well-established result of homogeneous polyelectrolyte 
solutions, we report a phenomenon where an aqueous solution of positively 
charged poly(L-lysine) (PLL) exhibits precipitation of similarly charged 
macromolecules at low ionic strength and a homogeneous solution at very high 
ionic strength, with a stable mesomorphic state of spherical aggregates as an 
interlude between these two limits. The precipitation at lower ionic strengths 
that is orthogonal to the standard polyelectrolyte behavior and the emergence of 
the mesomorphic state are triggered by the presence of a monovalent small 
organic anion, acrylate, in the electrolyte solution. Using light scattering, we 
find that the hydrodynamic radius Rh of isolated PLL chains shrinks upon a 
decrease in electrolyte (NaBr) concentration, exhibiting the 
"anti-polyelectrolyte effect." In addition, Rh of the aggregates in the 
mesomorphic state depends on PLL concentration cp according to the scaling law, 
[Formula: see text]. Furthermore, at higher PLL concentration, the mesomorphic 
aggregates disassemble by a self-poisoning mechanism. We conjecture that all 
these findings can be attributed to both intra- and interchain dipolar 
interactions arising from the transformation of polycationic PLL into a physical 
polyzwitterionic PLL at higher concentrations of acrylate. The reported 
phenomenon of PLL exhibiting dipole-directed assembly of mesomorphic states and 
the anti-polyelectrolyte effect are of vital importance toward understanding 
more complex situations such as coacervation and formation of biomolecular 
condensates.

Meiosis has a principal role in sexual reproduction to generate haploid gametes 
in both sexes. During meiosis, the cell nucleus hosts a dynamic environment 
where some genes are transcriptionally activated, and some are inactivated at 
the same time. This becomes possible through subnuclear compartmentalization. 
The sex body, sequestering X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis and creating 
an environment for the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) is one of the 
best known and studied subnuclear compartments. Herein, we show that MRNIP forms 
droplet-like accumulations that fuse together to create a distinct subnuclear 
compartment that partially overlaps with the sex body chromatin during 
diplotene. We demonstrate that Mrnip-/- spermatocytes have impaired DNA 
double-strand break (DSB) repair, they display reduced sex body formation and 
defective MSCI. We show that Mrnip-/- undergoes critical meiocyte loss at the 
diplotene stage. Furthermore, we determine that DNA DSBs (induced by SPO11) and 
synapsis initiation (facilitated by SYCP1) precede Mrnip expression in testes. 
Altogether, our findings indicate that in addition to an emerging role in DNA 
DSB repair, MRNIP has an essential function in spermatogenesis during meiosis I 
by forming drop-like accumulations interacting with the sex body.

Analytical processes involving sample preparation, separation, and quantifying 
analytes in complex mixtures are indispensable in modern-day analysis. Each step 
is crucial to enriching correct and informative results. Therefore, sample 
preparation is the critical factor that determines both the accuracy and the 
time consumption of a sample analysis process. Recently, several promising 
sample preparation approaches have been made available with environmentally 
friendly technologies with high performance. As a result of its many advantages, 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) is practiced in many different fields in addition 
to the traditional methods. The SPE is an alternative method to liquid-liquid 
extraction (LLE), which eliminates several disadvantages, including many organic 
solvents, a lengthy operation time and numerous steps, potential sources of 
error, and high costs. SPE advanced sorbent technology reorients with various 
functions depending on the structure of extraction sorbents, including 
reversed-phase, normal-phase, cation exchange, anion exchange, and mixed-mode. 
In addition, the commercial SPE systems are disposable. Still, with the 
continual developments, the restricted access materials (RAM) and molecular 
imprinted polymers (MIP) are fabricated to be active reusable extraction 
cartridges. This review will discuss all the theoretical and practical 
principles of the SPE techniques, focusing on packing materials, different 
forms, and performing factors in recent and future advances. The information 
about novel methodological and instrumental solutions in relation to different 
variants of SPE techniques, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), in-tube 
solid-phase microextraction (IT-SPME), and magnetic solid-phase extraction 
(MSPE) is presented. The integration of SPE with analytical chromatographic 
techniques such as LC and GC is also indicated. Furthermore, the applications of 
these techniques are discussed in detail along with their advantages in 
analyzing pharmaceuticals, biological samples, natural compounds, pesticides, 
and environmental pollutants, as well as foods and beverages.

The residues and abuse of antibiotics have seriously endangered ecological 
balance and human health; meanwhile, antibiotics determination is very difficult 
because of their low levels and multiple categories in complicated matrices. 
Appropriate sample pretreatment is usually imperative to enrich (ultra)trace 
antibiotics and eliminate matrix interference prior to chromatographic analysis. 
Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) has become an ideal 
pretreatment technique owing to its simplicity, effectiveness, low-consumption, 
etc. In this work, an ultrasonic-assisted DLLME (UA-DLLME) was developed for the 
simultaneous extraction of seven sulfonamides (SAs) antibiotics in environmental 
water and seafood samples coupled with HPLC-DAD determination. Several 
parameters affecting UA-DLLME efficiency were systematically optimized, and 
consequently the SAs were separated and detected within 14.5 min. The obtained 
limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 
0.7-7.8 μg/L and 2.4-26.0 μg/L for three water samples (seawater, aquaculture 
wastewater and lake water) and two seafood samples (pomfrets and shrimps). High 
recoveries (80.0-116.0%) with low relative standard deviations (0.1-8.1%) were 
achieved for all the tested samples at three spiked levels. Notably, 
sulfadimethoxine was found at 24.49 μg/L in one seawater sample. The facile, 
robust and benign DLLME-HPLC method demonstrated promising perspectives for 
multiresidue analysis of antibiotics.

Favipiravir is a promising antiviral agent that has been recently approved for 
treatment of COVID-19 infection. In this study, a menthol-assisted homogenous 
liquid-liquid microextraction method has been developed for favipiravir 
determination in human plasma using HPLC/UV. The different factors that could 
affect the extraction efficiency were studied, including extractant type, 
extractant volume, menthol amount and vortex time. The optimum extraction 
efficiency was achieved using 300 µL of tetrahydrofuran, 30 mg of menthol and 
vortexing for 1 min before centrifuging the sample for 5 min at 3467g. Addition 
of menthol does not only induce phase separation, but also helps to form reverse 
micelles to facilitate extraction. The highly polar favipiravir molecules would 
be incorporated into the hydrophilic core of the formed reverse micelle to be 
extracted by the non-polar organic extractant. The method was validated 
according to the FDA bioanalytical method guidelines. The developed method was 
found linear in the concentration range of 0.1 to 100 µg/mL with a coefficient 
of determination of 0.9992. The method accuracy and precision were studied by 
calculating the recovery (%) and the relative standard deviation (%), 
respectively. The recovery (%) was in the range of 97.1-103.9%, while the RSD 
(%) values ranged between 2.03 and 8.15 %. The developed method was successfully 
applied in a bioequivalence study of Flupirava® 200 mg versus Avigan® 200 mg, 
after a single oral dose of favipiravir administered to healthy adult 
volunteers. The proposed method was simple, cheap, more eco-friendly and 
sufficiently sensitive for biomedical application.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of SynGAP and PSD-95, two abundant 
proteins that interact in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons, has been 
implicated in modulating SynGAP PSD enrichment in excitatory synapses. However, 
the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we report that 
O-GlcNAcylation of SynGAP acts as a suppressor of LLPS of the SynGAP/PSD-95 
complex. We identified multiple O-GlcNAc modification sites for the endogenous 
SynGAP isolated from rat brain and the recombinantly expressed protein. Protein 
semisynthesis was used to generate site-specifically O-GlcNAcylated forms of 
SynGAP, and in vitro and cell-based LLPS assays demonstrated that T1306 O-GlcNAc 
of SynGAP blocks the interaction with PSD-95, thus inhibiting LLPS. Furthermore, 
O-GlcNAcylation suppresses SynGAP/PSD-95 LLPS in a dominant-negative manner, 
enabling sub-stoichiometric O-GlcNAcylation to exert effective regulation. We 
also showed that O-GlcNAc-dependent LLPS is reversibly regulated by O-GlcNAc 
transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). These findings demonstrate that OGT- 
and OGA-catalysed O-GlcNAc cycling may serve as an LLPS-regulating 
post-translational modification.

Limonene dioxide is recognized as a green monomer for the synthesis of a wide 
variety of polymers such as polycarbonates, epoxy resins, and nonisocyanate 
polyurethanes (NIPU). The developed green technologies for its synthesis over 
heterogeneous catalysts present a challenge in that the selectivity of limonene 
dioxide is rather low. Homogeneous epoxidation in the presence of 
dimethyldioxirane for limonene dioxide synthesis is a promising technology. This 
study reports the epoxidation of limonene by dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) using two 
approaches. The isolated synthesis of DMDO solution in acetone was followed by 
epoxidation of limonene in another reactor in 100% organic phase (stepwise 
epoxidation). Following this procedure, limonene dioxide could be produced with 
almost 100% conversion and yield. A second approach allowed using in situ 
generated in aqueous-phase DMDO to epoxidize the limonene forming a 
microemulsion with a solubilized surfactant in the absence of any organic 
solvent. The surfactants tested were hydrosulfate (CTAHS), bromide (CTAB), and 
chloride (CTAC) cetyltrimethylammonium. All these surfactants showed good 
stability of microemulsions at aqueous surfactant concentrations above their 
critical micellar concentrations (CMC). Stability is obtained at the lowest 
concentration when using CTAHS because of its very low CMC compared to CTAB and 
CTAC. The major advantages of epoxidation in microemulsions compared to DMDO 
stepwise epoxidation are the absence of an organic solvent (favoring a low 
reaction volume) and the very high oxygen yield of 60 to 70% versus 5% in a 
stepwise approach. The epoxides formed are easily separated from the aqueous 
medium and the surfactant by liquid-liquid extraction. Therefore, the developed 
in situ epoxidation process is a green technology conducted under mild 
conditions and convenient for large-scale applications.

Innate antiviral immunity deteriorates with aging but how this occurs is not 
entirely clear. Here we identified SIRT1-mediated DNA-binding domain (DBD) 
deacetylation as a critical step for IRF3/7 activation that is inhibited during 
aging. Viral-stimulated IRF3 underwent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
with interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element DNA and compartmentalized IRF7 
in the nucleus, thereby stimulating type I IFN (IFN-I) expression. SIRT1 
deficiency resulted in IRF3/IRF7 hyperacetylation in the DBD, which inhibited 
LLPS and innate immunity, resulting in increased viral load and mortality in 
mice. By developing a genetic code expansion orthogonal system, we demonstrated 
the presence of an acetyl moiety at specific IRF3/IRF7 DBD site/s abolish 
IRF3/IRF7 LLPS and IFN-I induction. SIRT1 agonists rescued SIRT1 activity in 
aged mice, restored IFN signaling and thus antagonized viral replication. These 
findings not only identify a mechanism by which SIRT1 regulates IFN production 
by affecting IRF3/IRF7 LLPS, but also provide information on the drivers of 
innate immunosenescence.

The formation of biomolecular condensates via liquid‒liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) is an advantageous strategy for cells to organize their subcellular 
compartments for diverse functions. Recent findings suggest that RNA or 
RNA-related LLPS techniques have potential for the development of new cellular 
regulation strategies. However, manipulating RNA LLPS in living cells has great 
challenges. Herein, we report that cationic polymers (CPs) have strong RNA 
LLPS-inducing activity. By introducing CPs into living cells or RNA solutions, 
significant RNA LLPS was verified through confocal imaging, turbidity assays, 
and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) tests. Among them, 
turbidity kinetics determinations indicated that the hydrophilic positively 
charged amino groups on the CPs play essential roles in RNA phase separation. 
Moreover, the LLPS induced by the cationic polymers dramatically changed the 
gene expression patterns in the cells. Interestingly, we found that TGFβ1 mRNA 
was highly encapsulated in the RNA droplets, which lowered the immunosuppressive 
capability of the tumor cells and triggered marked antitumor reactions in a 
mouse breast cancer model. Thus, we present here the CP-based modulation of RNA 
LLPS as a novel transcriptional manipulation method with potential for cancer 
immunotherapy drug development.

Conventional wisdom suggests that cations play a minimal role in the assembly of 
cationic amphiphiles. Here, we show that at liquid/liquid (L/L) interfaces, 
specific cation effects can modulate the assemblies of hydrophobic tails in an 
oil phase despite being attached to cationic headgroups in the aqueous phase. We 
used oligo-dimethylsiloxane (ODMS) methyl imidazolium amphiphiles to identify 
these specific interactions at hexadecane/aqueous interfaces. Small cations, 
such as Li+, bind to the O atoms in the ODMS tail and pin it to the interface, 
thereby imposing a kinked conformation─as evidenced by vibrational sum frequency 
generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. While larger Cs+ 
ions more readily partition to the interface, they do not form analogous 
complexes. Our data not only point to ways for controlling amphiphile structure 
at L/L interfaces but also suggest a means for the separation of Li+, or related 
applications, in soft-matter electronics.

Bucky ball was identified as germ plasm organizer in zebrafish and has proven 
crucial for Balbiani body condensation. A synteny comparison identified an 
uncharacterized gene locus in the chicken genome as predicted avian counterpart. 
Here, we present experimental evidence that this gene locus indeed encodes a 
'Bucky ball' equivalent in matured oocytes and early embryos of chicken. 
Heterologous expression of Bucky ball fusion proteins both from zebrafish and 
chicken with a fluorescent reporter revealed unique patterns indicative for 
liquid-liquid phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins. 
Immuno-labeling detected Bucky ball from oocytes to blastoderms with diffuse 
distribution in matured oocytes, aggregation in first cleavage furrows, and 
co-localization to the chicken vasa homolog (CVH). Later, Bucky ball 
translocated to the cytoplasm of first established cells, and showed nuclear 
translocation during the major zygotic activation together with CVH. Remarkably, 
during the phase of area pellucida formation, Bucky ball translocated back into 
the cytoplasm at stage EGK VI, whereas CVH remained within the nuclei. The 
condensation of Bucky ball and co-localization with CVH in cleavage furrows and 
nuclei of the centrally located cells strongly suggests chicken Bucky ball as a 
germ plasm organizer in birds, and indicate a special importance of the major 
zygotic activation for germline specification.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) emerges as a fundamental underlying 
mechanism for the biological organization, especially the formation of 
membraneless organelles (MLOs) hosting intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 
as scaffolds. Nucleic acids are compositional biomacromolecules of MLOs with 
wide implications in normal cell functions as well as in pathophysiology caused 
by aberrant phase behavior. Exploiting a minimalist artificial membraneless 
organelles (AMLO) from LLPS of IDP-mimicking polymer-oligopeptide hybrid (IPH), 
we investigated the effect of nucleic acids with different lengths and sequence 
variations on AMLO. The behavior of this AMLO in the presence of DNAs and RNAs 
resembled natural MLOs in multiple aspects, namely, modulated propensity of 
formation, morphology, liquidity, and dynamics. Both DNA and RNA could enhance 
the LLPS of AMLO, while compared with RNA, DNA had a higher tendency to solidify 
and diminish dynamics thereof. These findings suggest its potential as a concise 
model system for the understanding of the interaction between nucleic acids and 
natural MLOs and for studying the molecular mechanism of diseases involving 
MLOs.

A rapid and convenient analytical procedure (evaporation-assisted dispersive 
liquid-liquid microextraction with solidification of floating organic droplets) 
is advanced for determining the concentrations of triazine herbicide residues 
(e.g. simazine and atrazine) in fruit juices via HPLC-DAD. The technique 
involves adding 1-dodecanol (low density) and dichloromethane (high density) to 
the test solution to act as the extraction and volatile solvents, respectively. 
Calcium oxide is added to generate heat to accelerate the evaporation of 
dichloromethane, whereupon the 1-dodecanol quickly disperses into small droplets 
to complete the microextraction process. Thus, there is no need to use a 
dispersive solvent and heating equipment is also not required. The floating 
1-dodecanol is subsequently frozen using an ice bath to facilitate its 
separation from the sample. Under optimal conditions (250 μL of 1-dodecanol 
(extraction solvent), 150 μL of CH2Cl2 (volatile solvent), 1250 mg of CaO, and 
an extraction time of 60 s) the detection procedure is linear over the range 
0.05-5 μg mL-1 (with R > 0.99). The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification 
(LOQ) were determined to be 0.0022-0.0034 μg mL-1 and 0.0073-0.0113 μg mL-1, 
respectively. The recovery of simazine and atrazine in three fruit juices ranged 
between 78.5% and 96.4% with a relative standard deviation <8.2%. Therefore, the 
proposed approach can be effectively adopted to analyze the triazine herbicide 
content in fruit juices. The method has been proved to be simple, reliable, and 
remarkably efficient.

Metabolites represent the most downstream level of the cellular organization. 
Hence, an in vitro untargeted metabolomics approach is extremely valuable to 
deepen the understanding of how endogenous metabolites in cells are altered 
under a given biological condition. This chapter describes a robust liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and 
lipidomics platform applied to cell culture extracts. The analytical workflow 
includes an optimized sample preparation procedure to cover a wide range of 
metabolites using liquid-liquid extraction and validated instrumental operation 
procedures with the implementation of comprehensive quality assurance and 
quality control measures to ensure high reproducibility. The lipidomics platform 
is based on reversed-phase liquid chromatography for the separation of slightly 
polar to apolar metabolites and covers a broad range of lipid classes, while the 
metabolomics platform makes use of two hydrophilic interaction liquid 
chromatography methods for the separation of polar metabolites, such as organic 
acids, amino acids, and sugars. The chapter focuses on the analysis of cultured 
HepaRG cells that are derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma; however, 
the sample preparation and analytical platforms can easily be adapted for other 
types of cells.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are lesions that arise frequently from exposure 
to damaging agents as well as from ongoing physiological DNA transactions. 
Mis-repair of DSBs leads to rearrangements and structural variations in 
chromosomes, including insertions, deletions, and translocations implicated in 
disease. The DNA damage response (DDR) limits pathologic mutations and 
large-scale chromosome rearrangements. DSB repair initiates in 2D at DNA lesions 
with the stepwise recruitment of repair proteins and local chromatin remodeling 
which facilitates break accessibility. More complex structures are then formed 
via protein assembly into nanodomains and via genome folding into chromatin 
loops. Subsequently, 3D reorganization of DSBs is guided by clustering forces 
which drive the assembly of repair domains harboring multiple lesions. These 
domains are further stabilized and insulated into condensates via liquid-liquid 
phase-separation. Here, we discuss the benefits and risks associated with this 
3D reorganization of the broken genome.

Cells possess membraneless ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, including stress 
granules, processing bodies, Cajal bodies, or paraspeckles, that play 
physiological or pathological roles. RNP granules contain RNA and numerous 
RNA-binding proteins, transiently formed through the liquid-liquid phase 
separation. The assembly or disassembly of numerous RNP granules is strongly 
controlled to maintain their homeostasis and perform their cellular functions 
properly. Normal RNA granules are reversibly assembled, whereas abnormal RNP 
granules accumulate and associate with various neurodegenerative diseases. This 
review summarizes current studies on the physiological or pathological roles of 
post-translational modifications of various cellular RNP granules and discusses 
the therapeutic methods in curing diseases related to abnormal RNP granules by 
autophagy.

Coacervation is a liquid-liquid phase separation that can occur in solutions of 
macromolecules through self-assembly or electrostatic interactions. Recently, 
coacervates composed of biocompatible macromolecules have been actively 
investigated as nanostructure platforms to encapsulate and deliver biomolecules 
such as proteins, RNAs, and DNAs. One particular advantage of coacervates is 
that they are derived from aqueous solutions, unlike other nanoparticle delivery 
systems that often require organic solvents. In addition, coacervates achieve 
high loading while maintaining the viability of the cargo material. Here, we 
review recent developments in the applications of coacervates and their 
limitations in the delivery of therapeutic biomolecules. Important factors for 
coacervation include molecular structures of the polyelectrolytes, mixing ratio, 
the concentration of polyelectrolytes, and reaction conditions such as ionic 
strength, pH, and temperature. Various compositions of coacervates have been 
shown to deliver biomolecules in vitro and in vivo with encouraging activities. 
However, major hurdles remain for the systemic route of administration other 
than topical or local delivery. The scale-up of manufacturing methods suitable 
for preclinical and clinical evaluations remains to be addressed. We conclude 
with a few research directions to overcome current challenges, which may lead to 
successful translation into the clinic.

Protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) play crucial roles in diverse cellular pathways, 
from transcription to liquid-liquid phase separation, and its dysregulation is 
associated with a wide range of human disorders. Therefore, there is great 
emphasis on discovering small-molecule modulators that target unexplored PRIs by 
developing robust PRI assays. In particular, targeting PRIs could offer 
innovative solutions to expand the druggable genome, as only a small portion of 
protein-coding genes are currently targeted by drugs. This review describes the 
therapeutic potential of targeting PRIs using small molecules, biochemical and 
cell-based experimental tools for observing PRIs, and several PRI modulators. We 
also highlight emerging technologies and the challenges in developing PRI 
modulators.

Cells can achieve internal organization by exploiting liquid-liquid phase 
separation to form biomolecular condensates. Here we focus on the surface 
properties of condensates composed of two multivalent associative polymers held 
together by one-to-one "sticker" bonds. Using coarse-grained molecular-dynamics 
simulations, we study the influence of component stoichiometry on condensate 
surface properties. We find that unequal stoichiometry results in enrichment of 
the majority species at the interface and a sharp reduction of surface tension. 
To relate these two effects, we show that the reduction in surface tension 
scales linearly with the excess concentration of free binding sites at the 
interface. Our results imply that each excess free site contributes an 
approximately fixed additional energy and entropy to the interface, with the 
latter dominating such that enrichment of free majority sites lowers the surface 
tension. Our work provides insight into novel physical mechanisms by which cells 
can regulate condensate surface properties.

Given the biochemical reaction stochasticity, the mechanisms leading to 
conservation of biological functions from noise are obscure. Pervasive 
transcription of nonconserved genomic regions generates lowly expressed 
cancer-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). How such poorly expressed 
transcripts, often undetectable in normal tissues, consistently modulate the 
activity of multiple abundant proteins leading to cancer phenotypes is unclear. 
Biochemical reaction compartmentalisation in response to environmental 
oscillations through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) may explain the 
emergence of order from molecular noise. LncRNAs contain repetitive sequences 
and as such contribute to molecular crowding and LLPS. We propose that lncRNAs 
mediate cancer stress signals by regulating aberrant LLPS. This emerging model 
and its consequences for stoichiometry and specificity may lead to the 
development of diagnostic tools and cancer-specific drugs.

Green analytical chemistry (GAC) represents a rapidly growing research field 
that aims at developing novel analytical approaches with minimal consumption of 
hazardous reagents and solvents. The current study reports on a GAC methodology 
exploiting the unique physicochemical properties of natural deep eutectic 
solvents (NADESs), a supposedly environmentally friendly class of solvents. 
Based on a temperature-mediated strategy, the NADESs were manipulated to undergo 
multiple phase transitions for favorable functionality and performance. As 
proof-of-concept demonstrations, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic NADESs were 
prepared for the extraction and analysis of eight phthalate esters in aqueous 
samples (food simulants) and three aflatoxins in oily samples (edible oils), 
respectively. NADES-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) was 
employed to achieve high-efficiency sample pretreatment. Afterward, the NADESs 
were transformed from liquids into solids by tuning the peripheral temperature 
for a convenient phase separation from the sample matrices. The solidified NADES 
extracts were melted and vaporized at elevated temperatures by transmission-mode 
direct analysis in real time (DART) for further quadrupole-Orbitrap 
high-resolution mass spectrometry (Q-Orbitrap HRMS) analysis. The developed 
protocol was validated, achieving good repeatability with relative standard 
deviations (RSDs) of less than 9% and satisfactory sensitivity with limits of 
detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 and 0.2 to 2.0 
μg/kg, respectively. The greenness of the analytical methodology was assessed 
with the calculated scores of 0.66 and 0.57 for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
NADES-based protocols, respectively. The method was applied to marketed samples, 
highlighting the great potential for green chemical analysis.

BACKGROUND: Vertebrate CPEB proteins bind mRNAs at cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
elements (CPEs) in their 3' UTRs, leading to cytoplasmic changes in their 
poly(A) tail lengths; this can promote translational repression or activation of 
the mRNA. However, neither the regulation nor the mechanisms of action of the 
CPEB family per se have been systematically addressed to date.
RESULTS: Based on a comparative analysis of the four vertebrate CPEBs, we 
determine their differential regulation by phosphorylation, the composition and 
properties of their supramolecular assemblies, and their target mRNAs. We show 
that all four CPEBs are able to recruit the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex to 
repress the translation. However, their regulation, mechanism of action, and 
target mRNAs define two subfamilies. Thus, CPEB1 forms ribonucleoprotein 
complexes that are remodeled upon a single phosphorylation event and are 
associated with mRNAs containing canonical CPEs. CPEB2-4 are regulated by 
multiple proline-directed phosphorylations that control their liquid-liquid 
phase separation. CPEB2-4 mRNA targets include CPEB1-bound transcripts, with 
canonical CPEs, but also a specific subset of mRNAs with non-canonical CPEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results show how, globally, the CPEB family of 
proteins is able to integrate cellular cues to generate a fine-tuned adaptive 
response in gene expression regulation through the coordinated actions of all 
four members.

Many biomolecular condensates are thought to form via liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) of multivalent macromolecules. For those that form through 
this mechanism, our understanding has benefitted significantly from biochemical 
reconstitutions of key components and activities. Reconstitutions of RNA-based 
condensates to date have mostly been based on relatively simple collections of 
molecules. However, proteomics and sequencing data indicate that natural 
RNA-based condensates are enriched in hundreds to thousands of different 
components, and genetic data suggest multiple interactions can contribute to 
condensate formation to varying degrees. In this Perspective, we describe recent 
progress in understanding RNA-based condensates through different levels of 
biochemical reconstitutions as a means to bridge the gap between simple in vitro 
reconstitution and cellular analyses. Complex reconstitutions provide insight 
into the formation, regulation, and functions of multicomponent condensates. We 
focus on two RNA-protein condensate case studies: stress granules and RNA 
processing bodies (P bodies), and examine the evidence for cooperative 
interactions among multiple components promoting LLPS. An important concept 
emerging from these studies is that composition and stoichiometry regulate 
biochemical activities within condensates. Based on the lessons learned from 
stress granules and P bodies, we discuss forward-looking approaches to 
understand the thermodynamic relationships between condensate components, with 
the goal of developing predictive models of composition and material properties, 
and their effects on biochemical activities. We anticipate that quantitative 
reconstitutions will facilitate understanding of the complex thermodynamics and 
functions of diverse RNA-protein condensates.

Vertebrate embryogenesis involves a conserved and fundamental process, called 
the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), which marks the switch from a maternal 
factors-dominated state to a zygotic factors-driven state. Yet the precise 
mechanism underlying MZT remains largely unknown. Here we report that the RNA 
helicase Ddx3xb in zebrafish undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) via 
its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and an increase in ATP 
content promotes the condensation of Ddx3xb during MZT. Mutant form of Ddx3xb 
losing LLPS ability fails to rescue the developmental defect of Ddx3xb-deficient 
embryos. Interestingly, the IDR of either FUS or hnRNPA1 can functionally 
replace the N-terminal IDR in Ddx3xb. Phase separation of Ddx3xb facilitates the 
unwinding of 5' UTR structures of maternal mRNAs to enhance their translation. 
Our study reveals an unprecedent mechanism whereby the Ddx3xb phase separation 
regulates MZT by promoting maternal mRNA translation.

Carvedilol is a commonly used antihypertensive whose oral absorption is limited 
by low solubility and significant first-pass metabolism. This work aimed to 
apply chemometrics for the optimization of a salting-out assisted liquid-liquid 
extraction (SALLE) combined with LC-MS/MS to analyze carvedilol enantiomers in 
plasma samples. Method development and validation were driven for application in 
pharmacokinetic studies. Parameters that influence the efficiency of SALLE were 
evaluated using a fractional factorial 24-1 design with 4 factors and a central 
composite design was used to evaluate the optimal extraction condition. 
Carvedilol enantiomers and the internal standard lidocaine were separated on an 
Astec® Chirobiotic® V column and a mixture of methanol:ethanol (90:10, v/v) with 
0.02% diethylamine and 0.18% acetic acid as mobile phase. The positive ion mode 
on electrospray ionization was used to monitor the transitions of m/z 407 > 100 
and 235 > 86 for carvedilol enantiomers and lidocaine, respectively. 
Acetonitrile and ammonium acetate solution were selected for sample preparation 
by SALLE. Surface graphs and the desirability test were used to define the 
optimized SALLE conditions which resulted in 93% recovery for both carvedilol 
enantiomers. The method was linear in the range of 0.5 to 100 ng/mL in plasma, 
with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL. Within-run and between-run 
precision (as the relative standard deviation) were all < 9.74% and accuracy (as 
relative error) did not exceed ± 10.30%. Residual effect and matrix effect were 
not observed. Carvedilol enantiomers were stable in plasma under the storage, 
preparation, and analysis conditions. The validated method was successfully 
applied to analyze carvedilol in plasma samples from patients previously 
submitted to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery treated with a single oral dose 
of 25 mg racemic-carvedilol. Higher plasma concentrations were observed for 
(R)-(+)-carvedilol when compared to (S)-(-)-carvedilol in two patients 
post-bariatric surgery.

Marine mussels achieve strong underwater adhesion by depositing mussel foot 
proteins (Mfps) that form coacervates during the protein secretion. However, the 
molecular mechanisms that govern the phase separation behaviors of the Mfps are 
still not fully understood. Here, we report that GK-16*, a peptide derived from 
the primary adhesive protein Mfp-5, forms coacervate in seawater conditions. 
Molecular dynamics simulations combined with point mutation experiments 
demonstrate that Dopa- and Gly- mediated hydrogen-bonding interactions are 
essential in the coacervation process. The properties of GK-16* coacervates 
could be controlled by tuning the strength of the electrostatic and 
Dopa-mediated hydrogen bond interactions via controlling the pH and salt 
concentration of the solution. The GK-16* coacervate undergoes a pH induced 
liquid-to-gel transition, which can be utilized for the underwater delivery and 
curing of the adhesives. Our study provides useful molecular design principles 
for the development of mussel-inspired peptidyl coacervate adhesives with 
tunable properties.

Interaction of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) with 
specific single-stranded RNA and its relation to liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) were studied in vitro by magnetic resonance based on site-directed spin 
labelling. An ensemble model of dispersed hnRNP A1 in the absence of RNA was 
derived from distance distributions between spin labelled sites and small angle 
X-ray scattering. This model revealed a compact state of the low-complexity 
domain and its interaction with the RNA recognition motifs. Paramagnetic 
relaxation enhancement NMR spectroscopy confirmed this interaction. Addition of 
RNA to dispersed hnRNP A1 induced liquid-droplet formation. Such LLPS depended 
on RNA concentration and sequence, with continuous wave EPR spectroscopy showing 
an influence of RNA point mutations on local protein dynamics. We propose that 
an interplay of sequence-specific RNA binding and LLPS contributes to regulation 
of specific RNA segregation during stress response.

Insulin is synthesized by pancreatic β-cells and stored into secretory granules 
(SGs). SGs fuse with the plasma membrane in response to a stimulus and deliver 
insulin to the bloodstream. The mechanism of how proinsulin and its processing 
enzymes are sorted and targeted from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to SGs 
remains mysterious. No cargo receptor for proinsulin has been identified. Here, 
we show that chromogranin (CG) proteins undergo liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) at a mildly acidic pH in the lumen of the TGN, and recruit clients like 
proinsulin to the condensates. Client selectivity is sequence-independent but 
based on the concentration of the client molecules in the TGN. We propose that 
the TGN provides the milieu for converting CGs into a "cargo sponge" leading to 
partitioning of client molecules, thus facilitating receptor-independent client 
sorting. These findings provide a new receptor-independent sorting model in 
β-cells and many other cell types and therefore represent an innovation in the 
field of membrane trafficking.

Short tandem repeats are repetitive nucleotide sequences robustly distributed in 
the human genome. Their expansion underlies the pathogenesis of multiple 
neurological disorders, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
syndrome, and myotonic dystrophies, known as repeat expansion disorders (REDs). 
Several molecular pathomechanisms associated with toxic RNA containing expanded 
repeats (RNAexp ) are shared among REDs and contribute to disease progression, 
however, detailed mechanistic insight into those processes is limited. To deepen 
our understanding of the interplay between toxic RNAexp molecules and multiple 
protein partners, in this review, we discuss the roles of selected RNA-binding 
proteins (RBPs) that interact with RNAexp and thus act as "partners in crime" in 
the progression of REDs. We gather current findings concerning RBPs involved at 
different stages of the RNAexp life cycle, such as transcription, splicing, 
transport, and AUG-independent translation of expanded repeats. We argue that 
the activity of selected RBPs can be unique or common among REDs depending on 
the expanded repeat type. We also present proteins that are functionally 
depleted due to sequestration on RNAexp within nuclear foci and those which 
participate in RNAexp -dependent innate immunity activation. Moreover, we 
discuss the utility of selected RBPs as targets in the development of 
therapeutic strategies. This article is categorized under: RNA Interactions with 
Proteins and Other Molecules > Protein-RNA Interactions: Functional Implications

A new approach named PEG-assist is introduced for the production of drug-loaded 
polymeric micelles. The method is based on the use of PEG as the non-selective 
solvent for PEG-b-PLA in the fabrication procedure. Both hydration temperature 
and PEG molecular weight are shown to have a significant effect on the 
encapsulation efficiency of PTX in PEG4kDa-b-PLA2kDa micelles. The optimal 
procedure for fabrication includes the use of PEG1kDa as the solvent at 60 °C, 
cooling the mixture to 40 °C, hydration at 40 °C, freezing at -80 °C and 
freeze-drying at -35 °C, 15 Pa. No significant difference (p > 0.05) in PTX 
encapsulation, average particle size and polydispersity index is observed 
between the samples before freeze-drying and after reconstitution of the 
freeze-dried cake. The prepared PTX formulations are stable at room temperature 
for at least 8 h. Scaling the batch size to 25× leads to no significant change 
(p > 0.05) in PTX encapsulation, average particle size and polydispersity index. 
PEG-assist method is applicable to other drugs such as 17-AAG, and copolymers of 
varied molecular weights. The use of no organic solvent, simplicity, 
cost-effectiveness, and efficiency makes PEG-assist a very promising approach 
for large scale production of drug-loaded polymeric micelles.

Postmeiotic spermatids use a unique strategy to coordinate gene expression with 
morphological transformation, in which transcription and translation take place 
at separate developmental stages, but how mRNAs stored as translationally inert 
messenger ribonucleoproteins in developing spermatids become activated remains 
largely unknown. Here, we report that the RNA binding protein FXR1, a member of 
the fragile X-related (FXR) family, is highly expressed in late spermatids and 
undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to merge messenger 
ribonucleoprotein granules with the translation machinery to convert stored 
mRNAs into a translationally activated state. Germline-specific Fxr1 ablation in 
mice impaired the translation of target mRNAs and caused defective spermatid 
development and male infertility, and a phase separation-deficient FXR1L351P 
mutation in Fxr1 knock-in mice produced the same developmental defect. These 
findings uncover a mechanism for translational reprogramming with LLPS as a key 
driver in spermiogenesis.

This article describes dynamical simulations of the assembly of an icosahedral 
protein shell around a bicomponent fluid cargo. Our simulations are motivated by 
bacterial microcompartments, which are protein shells found in bacteria that 
assemble around a complex of enzymes and other components involved in certain 
metabolic processes. The simulations demonstrate that the relative interaction 
strengths among the different cargo species play a key role in determining the 
amount of each species that is encapsulated, their spatial organization, and the 
nature of the shell assembly pathways. However, the shell protein-shell protein 
and shell protein-cargo component interactions that help drive assembly and 
encapsulation also influence cargo composition within certain parameter regimes. 
These behaviors are governed by a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic 
effects. In addition to elucidating how natural microcompartments encapsulate 
multiple components involved within reaction cascades, these results have 
implications for efforts in synthetic biology to colocalize alternative sets of 
molecules within microcompartments to accelerate specific reactions. More 
broadly, the results suggest that coupling between self-assembly and 
multicomponent liquid-liquid phase separation may play a role in the 
organization of the cellular cytoplasm.

DEAD-box ATPases constitute a very large protein family present in all cells, 
often in great abundance. From bacteria to humans, they play critical roles in 
many aspects of RNA metabolism, and due to their widespread importance in RNA 
biology, they have been characterized in great detail at both the structural and 
biochemical levels. DEAD-box proteins function as RNA-dependent ATPases that can 
unwind short duplexes of RNA, remodel ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, or act 
as clamps to promote RNP assembly. Yet, it often remains enigmatic how 
individual DEAD-box proteins mechanistically contribute to specific 
RNA-processing steps. Here, we review the role of DEAD-box ATPases in the 
regulation of gene expression and propose that one common function of these 
enzymes is in the regulation of liquid-liquid phase separation of RNP 
condensates.

The physiological importance of biomolecular condensates is widely recognized, 
but how it is controlled in time and space during development is largely 
unknown. Here, we show that a tight junction protein ZO-1 forms cytoplasmic 
condensates in the trophectoderm (TE) of the mouse embryo before E4.0. These 
disappear via dissolution, and ZO-1 accumulates at the cell junction as the 
blastocyst cavity grows and internal pressure on TE cells increases. In 
contrast, this dissolution was less evident in TE cells attached to the inner 
cell mass because they receive weaker tensile forces. Furthermore, analyses 
using MDCK cells demonstrated that the ZO-1 condensates are generated and 
maintained by liquid-liquid phase separation. Our study also highlights that the 
dynamics of these condensates depends on the physical environment via an 
interaction between ZO-1 and F-actin. We propose that the force-dependent 
regulation of ZO-1 condensation contributes to the establishment of robust 
cell-cell adhesion during early development.

Stress granules (SGs), structurally dynamic, optically resolvable, 
macromolecular assemblies of mRNAs, RNA binding proteins (RBPs), translation 
factors, ribosomal subunits, as well as other interacting proteins, assemble in 
response to cell stress conditions that elicit phosphorylation of eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and consequently, the inactivation of translation 
initiation. SG biology is conserved throughout eukaryotes and has recently been 
linked to the pathological sequelae of neurodegenerative disorders, cancer 
biology, and viral infection. Substantial insights into mechanisms of SG 
biogenesis, and more broadly the phenomenon of biological liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS), have been aided by detailed proteomic and transcriptomic 
studies as well as in vitro reconstitution approaches. A particularly 
interesting and largely unexplored element of SG biology is the cell biological 
context of SG biogenesis, including its subcellular organization and more 
recently, evidence that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane may serve 
important functions in RNA granule biology generally and SG biogenesis 
specifically. A central role for the ER in SG biogenesis is discussed and a 
hypothesis linking SG formation on the ER to the trafficking, localization and 
de novo translation of newly exported mRNAs is presented.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an emerging and universal mechanism for 
intracellular organization, particularly, by forming membraneless organelles 
(MLOs) hosting intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) as scaffolds. Genetic 
engineering is generally applied to reconstruct IDPs harboring over 100 amino 
acid residues. Here, we report the first design of synthetic hybrids consisting 
of short oligopeptides of fewer than 10 residues as "stickers" and dextran as a 
"spacer" to recapitulate the characteristics of IDPs, as exemplified by the 
multivalent FUS protein. Hybrids undergo LLPS into micron-sized liquid droplets 
resembling LLPS in vitro and in living cells. Moreover, the droplets formed are 
capable of recruiting proteins and RNAs and providing a favorable environment 
for a biochemical reaction with highly enriched components, thereby mimicking 
the function of natural MLOs. This simple yet versatile model system can help 
elucidate the molecular interactions implicated in MLOs and pave ways to a new 
type of biomimetic materials.

The maintenance of genome stability and cellular homeostasis depends on the 
temporal and spatial coordination of successive events constituting the 
classical DNA damage response (DDR). Recent findings suggest close integration 
and coordination of DDR signaling with specific cellular processes. The 
mechanisms underlying such coordination remain unclear. We review emerging 
crosstalk between DNA repair factors, chromatin remodeling, replication, 
transcription, spatial genome organization, cytoskeletal forces, and 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in mediating DNA repair. We present an 
overarching DNA repair framework within which these dynamic processes intersect 
in nuclear space over time. Collectively, this interplay ensures the efficient 
assembly of DNA repair proteins onto shifting genome structures to preserve 
genome stability and cell survival.

RNA helicases (RHs) are a family of ubiquitous enzymes that alter RNA structures 
and remodel ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) using the energy typically 
through hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). RHs are involved in 
various aspects of RNA processing and metabolism, exemplified by transcriptional 
regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, miRNA biogenesis, liquid-liquid phase separation, 
and rRNA biogenesis among other molecular processes. Through these mechanisms, 
RHs contribute to vegetative and reproductive growth, as well as abiotic and 
biotic stress responses throughout the life cycle in plants. In this review, we 
systematically characterized RH-featured domains and signature motifs in 
Arabidopsis. We also summarized the functions and mechanisms of RHs in various 
biological processes in plants with a focus on DEAD-box and DEAH-box RNA 
helicases, aiming to present the latest pictures of RHs in plant biology.

Platinum (Pt) compounds such as oxaliplatin are among the most commonly 
prescribed anti-cancer drugs. Despite their considerable clinical impact, the 
molecular basis of platinum cytotoxicity and cancer specificity remain unclear. 
Here we show that oxaliplatin, a backbone for the treatment of colorectal 
cancer, causes liquid-liquid demixing of nucleoli at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Our data suggest that this biophysical defect leads to 
cell-cycle arrest, shutdown of Pol I-mediated transcription, and ultimately cell 
death. We propose that instead of targeting a single molecule, oxaliplatin 
preferentially partitions into nucleoli, where it modifies nucleolar RNA and 
proteins. This mechanism provides a general approach for drugging the increasing 
number of cellular processes linked to biomolecular condensates.

Fuzzy interactions are specific, variable contacts between proteins and other 
biomolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules) formed in accord to the 
cellular context. Fuzzy interactions have recently been demonstrated to regulate 
biomolecular condensates generated by liquid-liquid phase separation. The FuzDB 
v4.0 database (https://fuzdb.org) assembles experimentally identified examples 
of fuzzy interactions, where disordered regions mediate functionally important, 
context-dependent contacts between the partners in stoichiometric and 
higher-order assemblies. The new version of FuzDB establishes cross-links with 
databases on structure (PDB, BMRB, PED), function (ELM, UniProt) and 
biomolecular condensates (PhaSepDB, PhaSePro, LLPSDB). FuzDB v4.0 is a source to 
decipher molecular basis of complex cellular interaction behaviors, including 
those in protein droplets.

Deep eutectic solvents are a new generation of green solvents composed of 
hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. However, when used as extractants in 
liquid-liquid separation, they are difficult to recycle and easy to lose. In 
order to solve these problems, herein, immobilized hydrogen bond acceptor 
adsorbent material was prepared for the separation and enrichment of antiviral 
drug arbidol from seven kinds of environmental water samples by in situ 
formation of hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents. The structure, morphology and 
thermal stability of the adsorbents were characterized, the separation and 
enrichment conditions for the targeted analyte were optimized, and the 
adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics were investigated. It was found that the 
adsorbent material could effectively enrich trace arbidol with the recovery more 
than 95% at the concentration above 7.5 ng/mL, and the enrichment factor was as 
high as 634.7. Coexisting substances, such as NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2, did 
not interfere with the adsorption of arbidol, even if their concentration was 
high, up to 1.0 mol/L, and the relative recovery for real samples was in the 
range from 92.5% to 100.3%. Furthermore, the immobilized hydrogen bond acceptor 
could be recycled and reused, and the recovery of arbidol was still above 95% 
after 12 adsorption-desorption cycles. The mechanism study demonstrates that the 
synergistic effect of hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking is the primary factor 
for the high adsorption efficiency.

Lipid extraction is a critical step in sample preparation of lipidomics studies. 
Biphasic liquid-liquid extraction protocol with methyl tert-butyl ether 
(MTBE)/methanol (MeOH) as organic solvents are widely adopted by researchers 
nowadays as an eco-friendly replacement of classic Folch, and Bligh&Dyer 
protocols. Yet, it has some limitations such as suboptimal performance for the 
most polar lipids (e.g. acylcarnitines), complicated handling as it requires 
phase separation, and is therefore non-ideal for large-scale clinical studies. 
To advance the extraction protocol for large-scale clinical lipidomics, in this 
study we explored i) 6 different extraction solvent systems, ii) distinct 
processing procedures (sonication, mechanical cell lysis and bead homogenizer), 
and iii) also 7 different reconstitution solvents. The extraction systems 
investigated included biphasic systems MTBE/MeOH/H2O and Hexane/2-propanol 
(IPA)/1 M acetic acid, and monophasic systems MTBE/MeOH/CHCl3, IPA/H2O (90% 
IPA), MeOH/MTBE/IPA, and IPA/H2O/MTBE as solvent system for lipid extraction of 
human platelets. Extraction recovery was investigated by repeated extraction 
cycles. Subcellular extraction efficiency was assessed by the 
mitochondria-specific cardiolipins. It turned out that monophasic extraction 
with MeOH/MTBE/IPA (1.3:1:1, v/v/v), bead homogenizer for cell disruption and 
MeOH/MTBE (1:1, v/v) as reconstitution solvent provide optimal cellular and 
subcellular extraction efficiencies for both polar (e.g. acylcarnitines) and 
apolar lipids (e.g. triglycerides). It is simplified (no phase separation), 
eco-friendly (reduced solvent consumption and no halogenated ones), fast (5 min 
for 24 samples in parallel), and can be easily adapted for cells, plasma, and 
tissue. Therefore, it has great potential for large-scale clinical lipidomics 
studies.

PAMPA Membranes.

There is an increasing shift from dissolution testing to dissolution-permeation 
testing of formulations during formulation development and this has led 
increasing application of permeability measurements using parallel artificial 
membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) membranes. However, there is a lack of 
thorough analysis of the impact of variabilities in the PAMPA setup on the mass 
flow rate outcomes, particularly for complex solubility-enabling formulations. 
In this study, we investigated the impact of amorphous drug-rich nanodroplets, 
formed in supersaturated solutions by liquid-liquid phase separation, on 
membrane transport by measuring mass flow rate across PAMPA membranes. In 
addition, we explored the impact of PAMPA variants such as lipid composition, 
hydrophobicity and pore size of the filter support, as well as receiver sink 
properties on membrane mass flow rates of solutions containing amorphous 
nanodroplets. Filter properties and lipid composition did not show a notable 
influence on the mass flow rates for lipophilic molecules, while a marked impact 
was observed for hydrophilic molecules. High sink conditions in the receiver 
compartment, arising from addition of micellar surfactant, altered the membrane 
integrity for lipid-impregnated hydrophilic membranes. In contrast, no such 
effect was observed for a hydrophobic filter support. Membrane integrity tests 
also suggested that monitoring water transport may be an improved approach over 
using Lucifer yellow. Furthermore, high sink conditions in the receiver 
compartment resulted in an increase in the overall mass flow rate. This was due 
to the effect of asymmetric conditions, generated across the membrane, on mass 
transport kinetics. Linearity between mass flow rate and donor concentration was 
observed until the donor concentration reached the amorphous solubility. Above 
the amorphous solubility, a gradual increase in mass flow rate was observed 
i.e., with an increasing number of nanodroplets in the solution. This was 
attributed to decrease in the permeability barrier across unstirred water layer 
due to reduction of the concentration gradient as nanodroplets dissolved to 
replenish absorbed drug. Observations made in this study provide insights into 
the mechanisms associated with mass transport of supersaturated solutions across 
PAMPA membranes, which are critical for improved evaluation of enabling 
formulations.

BACKGROUND: The detection of new designer benzodiazepines in biological fluids 
and tissues, together with the traditional ones, could represent an important 
analytical update for laboratories performing clinical and forensic 
toxicological analysis.
OBJECTIVE: A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) 
has been developed, fully validated, and applied to a cohort of real urine 
samples collected from patients under withdrawal treatment and from intoxication 
cases.
METHODS: 100 μL urines were added to a buffer solution containing deuterated 
internal standards; the samples were then extracted through a liquid/liquid 
procedure, dried under a nitrogen stream, and reconstituted in mobile phase. The 
chromatographic separation was performed in reverse phase through a C18 column 
with gradient elution. Mass spectrometry operated in positive polarization and 
multiple reaction monitoring mode.
RESULTS: 25 molecules were optimized for instrumental analysis: 9 designer 
benzodiazepines and 16 traditional compounds (parent drugs and main 
metabolites). Sensitivity, specificity, linearity, accuracy, imprecision, 
recovery, matrix effects, and carry-over have been evaluated for all molecules. 
Only cinazepam did not satisfy all acceptance criteria for validation. 10 among 
the 50 analyzed samples tested positive for at least one of the monitored 
molecules. In particular, two different samples collected from the same case 
provided positive results for flubromazepam, a designer benzodiazepine.
CONCLUSION: The method was proven to be useful in detecting not only traditional 
benzodiazepines but also new designer ones. The identification of a New 
Psychoactive Substance in real samples confirmed that analytical procedures 
should be updated to include as many substances as possible.

Weak complementary interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are the main 
driving forces of intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation. The 
sticker-spacer model has emerged as a unifying principle for understanding the 
phase behavior of these multivalent molecules. It remains elusive how specific 
interactions mediated by stickers contribute to the rheological properties of 
the liquid condensates. Previous studies have revealed that for strong binding 
strength ɛ_{b}, the bulk diffusivity D depends on the effective bond lifetime τ, 
viz., D∝τ^{-1}. Consequently, equal concentrations of the complementary stickers 
induce a slow down in the dynamics of the condensates D∝e^{-1.5ɛ_{b}}. However, 
for weak-binding strength, it is expected that the resulting condensates are 
dynamic, loose network liquids rather than kinetically arrested, compact 
clusters. We develop a mean-field theory using the thermodynamics of the 
associative polymers and perform molecular-dynamics simulations based on the 
sticker-spacer model to study the controlling factors in the structure and 
dynamics of such condensates in the weak-binding regime. Through scaling 
analysis, we delineate how the free sticker fraction W_{f} and the bulk 
diffusivity D decrease with increasing binding energy and find that the internal 
dynamics of such network liquids are controlled by the free sticker fraction 
D∝W_{f}∝e^{-0.5ɛ_{b}} rather than the effective bond lifetime. Referred to as 
the free-sticker-dominated diffusivity, the microscopic slowdown due to a 
gradual loss of the free stickers affects the viscosity of the condensates as 
well, with the scaling of the zero-shear viscosity η∝e^{0.5ɛ_{b}}. Therefore, 
the way of controlling the structure, diffusivity, and viscosity of the 
condensates through the binding energy can be tested experimentally.

HYPOTHESIS: Supramolecular self-assemblies involving non-covalent interactions 
play important roles in material science as well as living systems as they 
result in unique properties and/or functions. However, understanding of their 
self-assembly mechanism and crystallization has remained rudimentary.
EXPERIMENT: Here, we focus on biomolecular fatty acid and dopamine, which 
commonly exist in biological systems and closely related to neurodegenerative 
diseases, and investigate their self-assembly pathway by optical and 
fluorescence microscopy, DLS, SAXS, TEM, 2D-NMR, etc. FINDINGS: It is found that 
they could form the crystalline plates in solution or via a metastable 
liquid - liquid phase separation (LLPS). The nucleation and growth of 
crystalline plates observed occurs in solution or the dilute phase of LLPS, and 
not within the concentrated coacervate phase. This is because in coacervate, 
dopamine intercalates into fatty acid through hydrophobic and electrostatic 
interaction, which hinders the rearrangement of molecules and nucleation 
process, whereas in solution or dilute phase, they have the mobility to arrange 
into ordered structures to maximize electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and π-π 
interactions, leading to nucleation and crystallization. Moreover, the 
transitions between the coacervates and crystalline phase can be realized by 
adjusting the temperature. Our results shed light on the multistep nucleation in 
the presence of LLPS, as well as molecular mechanisms involved, thus further 
extending the nucleation-growth mechanisms.

A method for the determination of 14 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in 
human serum using isotope internal standard-gas chromatography-high resolution 
dual-focus magnetic mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) was developed. After thawed to 
room temperature, 0.5 mL serum samples were mixed with 13C-labeled isotopic 
internal standard. Subsequently, methanol was added to precipitate the proteins 
in the samples. The effects of three kinds of acids on the removal of cellulite 
from the serum samples and the corresponding recoveries were compared, and the 
results revealed that sulfuric acid was the most optimal. The target compounds 
were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), and the effects of different 
extraction solvents on recoveries were compared. The results indicated that 
n-hexane (6 mL)-methyl tert-butyl ether (6 mL) was the best extraction solvent. 
The extracts were cleaned and eluted using solid phase extraction cartridges. 
Furthermore, the factors that influenced the cleanup effects and recoveries, 
including the solid phase extraction columns and elution solvents, were 
investigated in detail. The results indicated that the optimal conditions were 
cleanup with a silica gel column and elution with hexane-dichloromethane (1∶1, 
v/v). The eluate was re-dissolved in hexane after being blown to near dryness 
using nitrogen. The detection of PBDEs was performed using GC-HRMS. The 
instrument conditions were optimized, and the capillary column used was an 
Rtx-1614 column (30 m×0.25 mm×0.1 μm). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a 
flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injector temperature was 290 ℃, and the oven 
temperature was programmed as follows: 150 ℃ for 2 min, 150 ℃ to 250 ℃ at 15 
℃/min, held for 1 min, 250 ℃ to 290 ℃ at 25 ℃/min, held for 3 min, and 290 ℃ to 
320 ℃ at 25 ℃/min, held for 12.5 min. The injection volume was 1 μL in splitless 
mode. The samples were ionized in the positive electron ionization (EI) mode at 
35 eV. Precursor ions and the production of each compound were identified using 
a voltage-selective ion detection (VSIR) program with a resolution of 10000. The 
ionization temperature was set at 280 ℃, and the transmission line temperature 
was set at 320 ℃. To ensure the integrity of the separation of low-brominated 
components, the column separation time was shortened, the response of 
high-boiling components was improved (BDE-190 and BDE-209), the decomposition of 
BDE-209 on the chromatographic column was effectively prevented, and the 
requirement of the simultaneous determination of multiple PBDEs was met. The 
method demonstrated good linearity in the range of 0.40 to 25 μg/L for BDE-209, 
and 0.08 to 5 μg/L for the other 13 PBDEs, with correlation coefficients greater 
than 0.995. The method detection limits (MDLs) were in the range of 0.01 to 0.51 
μg/L, and the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.04 to 1.70 μg/L. The 
recoveries of the 14 compounds ranged from 75.5% to 120.7%. The intra-day 
relative standard deviations (RSDs) were within 3.8%-10.9% (n=6) and the 
inter-day RSDs were within 4.2% to 12.4% (n=6). This method was successfully 
applied to the determination of 14 PBDEs in 15 serum samples from an adolescent 
population in an area. Notably, 1.86 to 4.66 ng/g lipid BDE-47 was detected in 
the serum samples with a detection frequency of 100%, and the other compounds 
were not detected. The results imply that the adolescent population in this 
region was exposed to some PBDE. Compared with the existing methods reported, 
this method has less sample demand and higher sensitivity and accuracy, can 
simultaneously determine 14 PBDEs, including BDE-209 in human serum, and 
effectively improve the efficiency of detection. This study offers a new method 
for studying the impact of polybrominated diphenyl ethers on population health 
in China.

Magnetic ionic liquids (MILs) are materials of special interest in analytical 
chemistry and, particularly, in analytical microextraction. These solvents 
possess several of the properties derived from their inherent nature of ionic 
liquids, combined with their magnetism, that permits their manipulation with an 
external magnetic field. This feature allows for performing typical steps of the 
microextraction procedure in a simpler manner with the aid of a strong magnet. 
Although there are several important reviews summarizing the most innovative 
advances in this field, there is a gap of information, as they do not provide 
useful details and tips related to the experimental set up of these procedures. 
This tutorial review fills this gap by providing a guide for the proper handling 
of MILs, their manipulation with magnets, and their proper hyphenation with the 
most used analytical techniques. Attention is paid to dispersive liquid-liquid 
microextraction, stir-bar dispersive liquid microextraction, aqueous biphasic 
systems, and single-drop microextraction, for being the analytical 
microextraction techniques mostly employed with MILs. This review also 
introduces a classification of the MILs employed in analytical microextraction 
in three classes (denoted as A, B, and C) as a function of the MIL nature 
(metal-containing anion, metal-containing cation, and radical-containing ion), 
and discuss about the prospect and future trends regarding new MIL families in 
microextraction together with new directions expected in these procedures.

Cytoplasmic inclusions containing aberrant proteolytic fragments of TDP-43 are 
associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and other related 
pathologies. In FTLD, TDP-43 is translocated into the cytoplasm and 
proteolytically cleaved to generate a prion-like domain (PrLD) containing 
C-terminal fragments (C25 and C35) that form toxic inclusions. Under stress, 
TDP-43 partitions into membraneless organelles called stress granules (SGs) by 
coacervating with RNA and other proteins. To study the factors that influence 
the dynamics between these cytoplasmic foci, we investigated the effects of 
cysteine-rich granulins (GRNs 1-7), which are the proteolytic products of 
progranulin, a protein implicated in FTLD, on TDP-43. We show that extracellular 
GRNs, typically generated during inflammation, internalize and colocalize with 
PrLD as puncta in the cytoplasm of neuroblastoma cells but show less likelihood 
of their presence in SGs. In addition, we show GRNs and PrLD coacervate to 
undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) or form gel- or solid-like 
aggregates. Using charge patterning and conserved cysteines among the wild-type 
GRNs as guides, along with specifically engineered mutants, we discover that the 
negative charges on GRNs drive LLPS while the positive charges and the redox 
state of cysteines modulate these phase transitions. Furthermore, RNA and GRNs 
compete and expel one another from PrLD condensates, providing a basis for GRN's 
absence in SGs. Together, the results help uncover potential modulatory 
mechanisms by which extracellular GRNs, formed during chronic inflammatory 
conditions, could internalize and modulate cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions in 
proteinopathies.

As a major microtubule-associated protein, tau is involved in the assembly of 
microtubules in the central nervous system. However, under pathological 
conditions tau assembles into amyloid filaments. Liquid droplets formed by 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) are a recently identified assembly state 
of tau and may have a major effect on the physiological function of tau and the 
formation of tau aggregates. 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitously expressed in 
various tissues and regulate a wide variety of biological processes. In this 
work, we demonstrate that 14-3-3ζ is recruited into tau droplets and regulates 
tau LLPS by in vitro assays. While the mobility of tau molecules inside the 
droplets is not affected in the presence of 14-3-3ζ, the amount and size of 
droplets can vary significantly. Mechanistic studies reveal that 14-3-3ζ 
regulates tau LLPS by electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions 
with the proline-rich domain and the microtubule-binding domain of tau. 
Surprisingly, the disordered C-terminal tail rather than the amphipathic binding 
groove of 14-3-3ζ plays a key role. Our findings not only provide a novel 
dimension to understand the interactions between 14-3-3 proteins and tau, but 
also suggest that 14-3-3 proteins may play an important role in regulating the 
LLPS of their binding partners.

Elastin-like proteins (ELPs) are biologically important proteins and models for 
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and dynamic structural transitions 
associated with coacervates and liquid-liquid phase transitions. However, the 
conformational status below and above coacervation temperature and its role in 
the phase separation process is still elusive. Employing matrix least-squares 
global Boltzmann fitting of the circular dichroism spectra of the ELPs (VPGVG)20 
, (VPGVG)40 , and (VPGVG)60 , we found that coacervation occurs sharply when a 
certain number of repeat units has acquired β-turn conformation (in our sequence 
setting a threshold of approx. 20 repeat units). The character of the 
differential scattering of the coacervate suspensions indicated that this 
fraction of β-turn structure is still retained after polypeptide assembly. Such 
conformational thresholds may also have a role in other protein assembly 
processes with implications for the design of protein-based smart materials.

SRRM2 is a nuclear-speckle marker containing multiple disordered domains, whose 
dysfunction is associated with several human diseases. Using mainly EGFP-SRRM2 
knock-in HEK293T cells, we show that SRRM2 forms biomolecular condensates 
satisfying most hallmarks of liquid-liquid phase separation, including spherical 
shape, dynamic rearrangement, coalescence and concentration dependence supported 
by in vitro experiments. Live-cell imaging shows that SRRM2 organizes nuclear 
speckles along the cell cycle. As bona-fide splicing factor present in 
spliceosome structures, SRRM2 deficiency induces skipping of cassette exons with 
short introns and weak splice sites, tending to change large protein domains. In 
THP-1 myeloid-like cells, SRRM2 depletion compromises cell viability, 
upregulates differentiation markers, and sensitizes cells to anti-leukemia 
drugs. SRRM2 induces a FES splice isoform that attenuates innate inflammatory 
responses, and MUC1 isoforms that undergo shedding with oncogenic properties. We 
conclude that SRRM2 acts as a scaffold to organize nuclear speckles, regulating 
alternative splicing in innate immunity and cell homeostasis.

Collagen is the major protein component of the extracellular matrix. Synthesis 
of procollagens starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and three α chains 
form a rigid triple helix 300-400 nm in length. It remains unclear how such a 
large cargo is transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. In this study, to 
elucidate the intracellular transport of fibril-forming collagens, we fused 
cysteine-free GFP to the N-telopeptide region of procollagen III (GFP-COL3A1) 
and analyzed transport by live-cell imaging. We found that the maturation 
dynamics of procollagen III was largely different from that of network-forming 
procollagen IV. Proline hydroxylation of procollagen III uniquely triggered the 
formation of intralumenal droplet-like structures, similarly to events caused by 
liquid-liquid phase separation, and ER exit sites surrounded large droplets 
containing chaperones. Procollagen III was transported to the Golgi apparatus 
via vesicular and tubular carriers containing ERGIC53 and RAB1B; this process 
required TANGO1 and CUL3, which we previously reported to be dispensable for 
procollagen IV. GFP-COL3A1 and mCherry-α1AT were cotransported in the same 
vesicle. Based on these findings, we propose that shortly after ER exit, 
enlarged carriers containing procollagen III fuse to ERGIC for transport to the 
Golgi apparatus by conventional cargo carriers.

The NDE1 gene encodes a scaffold protein essential for brain development. 
Although biallelic NDE1 loss of function (LOF) causes microcephaly with profound 
mental retardation, NDE1 missense mutations and copy number variations are 
associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the etiology of 
the diverse phenotypes resulting from NDE1 aberrations remains elusive. Here we 
demonstrate Nde1 controls neurogenesis through facilitating H4K20 
trimethylation-mediated heterochromatin compaction. This mechanism patterns 
diverse chromatin landscapes and stabilizes constitutive heterochromatin of 
neocortical neurons. We demonstrate that NDE1 can undergo dynamic liquid-liquid 
phase separation, partitioning to the nucleus and interacting with 
pericentromeric and centromeric satellite repeats. Nde1 LOF results in nuclear 
architecture aberrations and DNA double-strand breaks, as well as instability 
and derepression of pericentromeric satellite repeats in neocortical neurons. 
These findings uncover a pivotal role of NDE1/Nde1 in establishing and 
protecting neuronal heterochromatin. They suggest that heterochromatin 
instability predisposes a wide range of brain dysfunction.

Although the main players of the strigolactone (SL) signaling pathway have been 
characterized genetically, how they regulate plant development is still poorly 
understood. Of central importance are the SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE (SMXL) 
proteins that belong to a family of eight members in Arabidopsis thaliana, of 
which one subclade is involved in SL signaling and another one in the pathway of 
the chemically related karrikins. Through proteasomal degradation of these 
SMXLs, triggered by either DWARF14 (D14) or KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), 
several physiological processes are controlled, such as, among others, shoot and 
root architecture, seed germination, and seedling photomorphogenesis. Yet 
another clade has been shown to be involved in vascular development, 
independently of the D14 and KAI2 actions and not relying on proteasomal 
degradation. Despite their role in several aspects of plant development, the 
exact molecular mechanisms by which SMXLs regulate them are not completely 
unraveled. To fill the major knowledge gap in understanding D14 and KAI2 
signaling, SMXLs are intensively studied, making it challenging to combine all 
the insights into a coherent characterization of these important proteins. To 
this end, this review provides an in-depth exploration of the recent data 
regarding their physiological function, evolution, structure, and molecular 
mechanism. In addition, we propose a selection of future perspectives, focusing 
on the apparent localization of SMXLs in subnuclear speckles, as observed in 
transient expression assays, which we couple to recent advances in the field of 
biomolecular condensates and liquid-liquid phase separation.

Sumoylation is an essential post-translational modification that is catalysed by 
a small number of modifying enzymes but regulates thousands of target proteins 
in a dynamic manner. Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) can be attached to 
target proteins as one or more monomers or in the form of polymers of different 
types. Non-covalent readers recognize SUMO-modified proteins via SUMO 
interaction motifs. SUMO simultaneously modifies groups of functionally related 
proteins to regulate predominantly nuclear processes, including gene expression, 
the DNA damage response, RNA processing, cell cycle progression and 
proteostasis. Recent progress has increased our understanding of the cellular 
and pathophysiological roles of SUMO modifications, extending their functions to 
the regulation of immunity, pluripotency and nuclear body assembly in response 
to oxidative stress, which partly occurs through the recently characterized 
mechanism of liquid-liquid phase separation. Such progress in understanding the 
roles and regulation of sumoylation opens new avenues for the targeting of SUMO 
to treat disease, and indeed the first drug blocking sumoylation is currently 
under investigation in clinical trials as a possible anticancer agent.

Understanding the supersaturation and precipitation behavior of poorly 
water-soluble compounds in vivo and the impact on oral absorption is critical to 
design consistently performing products with optimized bioavailability. Weakly 
basic compounds are of particular importance in this context since they have an 
inherent tendency to undergo supersaturation in vivo upon exit from the stomach 
and entry into the small intestine because of their pH-dependent solubility. To 
understand and probe potential in vivo variability of supersaturating systems, 
rigorous understanding of compound physical properties and phase behavior 
landscape is essential. Herein, we extensively characterize the solution phase 
behavior of a model, poorly soluble and weakly basic compound, posaconazole. 
Phase boundaries for crystal-solution and amorphous-solution were established as 
a function of pH, allowing possible phase transformations, namely, 
crystallization or liquid-liquid phase separation, to be mapped for different 
initial doses and fluid volumes. Endogenous surfactants including sodium 
taurocholate, lecithin, glycerol monooleate, and sodium oleate in biorelevant 
media significantly extended the phase boundaries due to solubilization, to an 
extent that was dependent on the concentration of the surface-active agents. The 
nucleation induction time of posaconazole was much shorter in biorelevant media 
in comparison to the corresponding buffer solution, with two distinct regions 
observed in all media that could be attributed to a change in the nucleation 
mechanism at high and low supersaturation. The presence of undissolved 
nanocrystals accelerated the desupersaturation. This work enhances our 
understanding of biorelevant factors impacting precipitation kinetics, which 
might affect absorption in vivo. It is expected that findings from this study 
with posaconazole could be broadly applicable to other weakly basic compounds, 
after taking into consideration differences in pKa, solubility, and molecular 
structure.

Systemic candidiasis is the fourth leading cause of healthcare-associated 
infections worldwide. The combination therapy based on existing antifungal 
agents is well-established to overcome drug resistance and restore antifungal 
efficacy against drug-resistant strains. In this study, a simple and sensitive 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was 
developed to quantify the intracellular fluconazole (FLC) content in the 
opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The cell lysates were 
prepared by lysing C. albicans cells with Precellys homogenizers and FLC was 
extracted with methylene chloride. The entire extraction approach was simple, 
precise and reliable. The extracts were separated on a Zorbax SB-C18 column 
using a mobile phase of acetonitrile (solvent A) and deionized water plus 0.1% 
formic acid. FLC and ketoconazole (KCZ, internal standard) were monitored in 
positive mode using electrospray ionization source. The multiple reaction 
monitoring transitions (precursor to product) were monitored for FLC m/z 307.1 → 
238.2 and for the internal standard KCZ m/z 531.2 → 489.1. The linear for this 
method were in the range from 5.0 to 1000.0 ng/mL. The precision and accuracy of 
the samples were relative standard deviations (RSD) < 1.0% for intra-day and RSD 
< 0.51% for inter-day. The overall recovery of FLC from samples was higher than 
77.61%. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied and validated in 36 
clinical isolated strains. Taken together, we established a highly accurate, 
efficient, and reproducible method for quantifying the intracellular content of 
FLC in C. albicans.

The Processing-body is a conserved membraneless organelle that has been 
implicated in the storage and/or decay of mRNAs. Although Processing-bodies have 
been shown to be induced by a variety of conditions, the mechanisms controlling 
their assembly and their precise physiological roles in eukaryotic cells are 
still being worked out. In this study, we find that a distinct subtype of 
Processing-body is induced in response to conditions that disrupt microtubule 
integrity in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For example, treatment 
with the microtubule-destabilizing agent, benomyl, led to the induction of these 
novel ribonucleoprotein granules. A link to microtubules had been noted 
previously and the observations here extend our understanding by demonstrating 
that the induced foci differ from traditional P-bodies in a number of 
significant ways. These include differences in overall granule morphology, 
protein composition, and the manner in which their induction is regulated. Of 
particular note, several key Processing-body constituents are absent from these 
benomyl-induced granules, including the Pat1 protein that is normally required 
for efficient Processing-body assembly. However, these novel ribonucleoprotein 
structures still contain many known Processing-body proteins and exhibit similar 
hallmarks of a liquid-like compartment. In all, the data suggest that the 
disruption of microtubule integrity leads to the formation of a novel type of 
Processing-body granule that may have distinct biological activities in the 
cell. Future work will aim to identify the biological activities of these 
benomyl-induced granules and to determine, in turn, whether these 
Processing-body-like granules have any role in the regulation of microtubule 
dynamics.

In this work, we performed a comparative study of the formation of PML bodies by 
full-length PML isoforms and their C-terminal domains in the presence and 
absence of endogenous PML. Based on the analysis of the distribution of 
intrinsic disorder predisposition in the amino acid sequences of PML isoforms, 
regions starting from the amino acid residue 395 (i.e., sequences encoded by 
exons 4-6) were assigned as the C-terminal domains of these proteins. We 
demonstrate that each of the full-sized nuclear isoforms of PML is capable of 
forming nuclear liquid-droplet compartments in the absence of other PML 
isoforms. These droplets possess dynamic characteristics of the exchange with 
the nucleoplasm close to those observed in the wild-type cells. Only the 
C-terminal domains of the PML-II and PML-V isoforms are able to be included in 
the composition of the endogenous PML bodies, while being partially distributed 
in the nucleoplasm. The bodies formed by the C-terminal domain of the PML-II 
isoform are dynamic liquid droplet compartments, regardless of the presence or 
absence of endogenous PML. The C-terminal domain of PML-V forms dynamic liquid 
droplet compartments in the knockout cells (PML-/-), but when the C-terminus of 
the PML-V isoform is inserted into the existing endogenous PML bodies, the 
molecules of this protein cease to exchange with the nucleoplasm. It was 
demonstrated that the K490R substitution, which disrupts the PML sumoylation, 
promotes diffuse distribution of the C-terminal domains of PML-II and PML-V 
isoforms in endogenous PML knockout HeLa cells, but not in the wild-type cells. 
These data indicate the ability of the C-terminal domains of the PML-II and 
PML-V isoforms to form dynamic liquid droplet-like compartments, regardless of 
the ordered N-terminal RBCC motifs of the PML. This indicates a significant role 
of the non-specific interactions between the mostly disordered C-terminal 
domains of PML isoforms for the initiation of liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) leading to the formation of PML bodies.

In human biomonitoring, a high-throughput extraction and enrichment method for 
multiple types of organic contaminants at the part-per-trillion level is 
critical yet challenging, especially in the limited sample volume. When 
large-scale sample analysis is involved, low cost is often what we should 
consider. We describe a generic and straightforward cold-induced liquid-liquid 
extraction (CI-LLE) strategy to meet this need. Current methods for extracting 
and enriching organic contaminants from biological samples often require 
multistep sample processing, including specially tailoring the extraction 
solvent or adsorbents. This method uses cold-induced phase separation to achieve 
the extraction and enrichment of studied organic contaminants by adjusting the 
proportion of acetonitrile/water mixture, so as to integrate the extraction and 
enrichment in one step without additional reagents and adsorbents. In this 
study, fipronil insecticide was used as a representative compound to determine 
the key parameters of CI-LLE. The optimized CI-LLE procedure allowed 
simultaneous extraction and enrichment of studied organic contaminants, 
providing excellent enrichment factors (especially for lipophilic organic 
contaminants). CI-LLE was further applied in monitoring early life exposures of 
fipronil in 109 breast milk samples. This study provided baseline data on 
fipronil levels in breast milk samples from China. For infants, exposure to 
fipronil is of concern. In summary, CI-LLE provides a feasible solution for a 
generic, efficient, and low-cost preparation of biological samples and promotes 
high-throughput batch analysis of organic contaminants for large-scale human 
biomonitoring.

Functional mesoporous materials have gained tremendous attention due to their 
distinctive properties and potential applications. In recent decades, the 
self-assembly of micelles and framework precursors into mesostructures on the 
liquid-solid, liquid-liquid, and gas-liquid interface has been explored in the 
construction of functional mesoporous materials with diverse compositions, 
morphologies, mesostructures, and pore sizes. Compared with the one-phase 
solution synthetic approach, the introduction of a two-phase interface in the 
synthetic system changes self-assembly behaviors between micelles and framework 
species, leading to the possibility for the on-demand fabrication of unique 
mesoporous architectures. In addition, controlling the interfacial tension is 
critical to manipulate the self-assembly process for precise synthesis. In 
particular, recent breakthroughs based on the concept of the "monomicelles" 
assembly mechanism are very promising and interesting for the synthesis of 
functional mesoporous materials with the precise control. In this review, we 
highlight the synthetic strategies, principles, and interface engineering at the 
macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale for oriented interfacial assembly of 
functional mesoporous materials over the past 10 years. The potential 
applications in various fields, including adsorption, separation, sensors, 
catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, and biomedicine, are discussed. Finally, 
we also propose the remaining challenges, possible directions, and opportunities 
in this field for the future outlook.

The effect of gender and body mass index (BMI) on the pharmacokinetics of 
rivastigmine was studied in Egyptian human subjects using new bio-analytical 
validated LC/MS/MS method. In this study, Rivastigmine was estimated in human 
plasma using Escitalopram as an internal standard (IS). Rivastigmine and 
Escitalopram were extracted from human plasma samples by liquid-liquid 
extraction using diethyl ether (DEE)-dichloromethane (DCM) (70:30, v/v). 
Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 INERTSIL ODS 
column using 0.05% aqueous formic acid, acetonitrile in the ratio (50:50, v/v) 
as a mobile phase. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was applied and operated 
by positive mode electrospray ionization. A significant difference between male 
and female Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) (P = 0.0205; CL = 95.4) was found 
using Mann-Whitney U test. Also, a moderate negative correlation was found 
between BMI and Tmax (time to peak plasma concentration) using spearman rho 
test. The calculated results confirm the difference of Rivastigmine 
pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects. Furthermore, it indicates 
that Rivastigmine dose adjustment may be necessary. The method was applied for 
the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters in volunteers (n = 26, 17 male and 
9 female) and the effects of gender and BMI were investigated.

Liquid-liquid extraction methods are widely used for sample treatment in 
bioanalysis, although their implementation poses a common speed-limiting step in 
the analytical process when fast separation and detection methods such as 
UHPLC-MS are used. This study aimed to develop high-throughput salting-out 
assisted liquid-liquid extraction on a 96-well plate in combination with fast 
LC-MS analysis of ibrutinib and its active metabolite PCI-45227 (dihydrodiol 
ibrutinib) in human serum. A specially designed 3D printed extraction device 
developed in our laboratory allowed for the precise and rapid collection of the 
organic phase from the 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette, without the 
risk of aspiration of the bottom aqueous layer. The application of this device 
significantly accelerated sample preparation and allowed the processing of up to 
96 samples in 1 h. The method was successfully validated according to EMA 
guidelines in the concentration range of 0.1-200 ng/mL for both analytes, 
providing lower limit of quantification at 100 pg/mL. The intra-day accuracy for 
IBT was in the range of - 1.67-5.67 %, while the inter-day accuracy was in the 
range of 0.20-6.90 %. The intra-day precision for IBT was in the range of 
3.20-4.37 % and 3.13-4.73 % for the inter-day measurement. PCI-45227 showed 
intra-day accuracy in the range of - 11.2-3.71 % and the inter-day accuracy in 
the range of - 5.76-0.92 %. The intra-day precision for PCI was in the range of 
3.49-7.64 % and 3.63-8.61 % for the measurement between days. In addition to 
increasing the speed of sample preparation, this method also offers low 
consumption of the sample and extraction solvent and can be utilized for other 
similar small-volume in-well plate extractions where organic solvents of lower 
density than water are used. The method was successfully applied to the analysis 
of serum samples (n = 5) of patients with chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia at the 
trough level (ibrutinib concentration range: 1.63-3.78 ng/mL, PCI-45227 
concentration range: 1.84-14.02 ng/mL) and 2 h postdose (ibrutinib concentration 
range: 7.34-89.0 ng/mL, PCI-45227 concentration range: 5.64-124 ng/mL).

Protein-based condensates have been proposed to accelerate biochemical reactions 
by enriching reactants and enzymes simultaneously. Here, we engineered those 
condensates into a photo-activated switch in Escherichia coli (PhASE) to 
regulate enzymatic reactions via tuning the spatial correlation of enzymes and 
substrates. In this system, scaffold proteins undergo liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) to form light-responsive compartments. Tethered with a 
light-responsive protein, enzymes of interest (EOIs) can be recruited by those 
compartments from cytosol within only a few seconds after a pulse of light 
induction and fully released in 15 min. Furthermore, we managed to enrich small 
molecular substrates simultaneously with enzymes in the compartments and 
achieved the acceleration of luciferin and catechol oxidation by 2.3- and 
1.6-folds, respectively. We also developed a quantitative model to guide the 
further optimization of this demixed regulatory system. Our tool can thus be 
used to study the rapid redistribution of proteins, and reversibly regulate 
enzymatic reactions in E. coli.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are essential components for the 
formation of membraneless organelles, which play key functional and regulatory 
roles within biological systems. These complex assemblies form and dissolve 
spontaneously over time via liquid-liquid phase separation of IDPs. Mutations in 
their amino acid sequence can alter their phase behavior, which has been linked 
to the emergence of severe diseases. We study the conformation and phase 
behavior of a low-complexity domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
A1 (hnRNPA1) using coarse-grained implicit solvent molecular dynamics 
simulations. We systematically analyze how these properties are affected by the 
number of aromatic residues within the examined sequences. We find a significant 
compaction of the chains and an increase in the critical temperature with an 
increasing number of aromatic residues. The local persistence length is 
determined in single-chain simulations, revealing strong sequence-specific 
variations along the chain contour. Comparing single-chain and condensed-state 
simulations, we find many more collapsed polymer conformations in the dilute 
systems, even at temperatures near the estimated θ-temperature of the solution. 
These observations strongly support the hypothesis that aromatic residues play a 
dominant role in condensation, which is further corroborated by a detailed 
analysis of the intermolecular contacts, and conversely that important 
properties of condensates are captured in coarse-grained simulations. 
Interestingly, we observe density inhomogeneities within the condensates near 
criticality, which are driven by electrostatic interactions. Finally, we find 
that the relatively small fraction of hydrophobic residues in the IDPs results 
in interfacial tensions, which are significantly lower compared to typical 
combinations of immiscible simple liquids.

Biomolecular condensation via liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and 
nucleic acids is associated with a range of critical cellular functions and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate that complex coacervation of 
the prion protein and α-synuclein within narrow stoichiometry results in the 
formation of highly dynamic, reversible, thermo-responsive liquid droplets via 
domain-specific electrostatic interactions between the positively-charged 
intrinsically disordered N-terminal segment of prion and the acidic C-terminal 
tail of α-synuclein. The addition of RNA to these coacervates yields 
multiphasic, vesicle-like, hollow condensates. Picosecond time-resolved 
measurements revealed the presence of transient electrostatic nanoclusters that 
are stable on the nanosecond timescale and can undergo breaking-and-making of 
interactions on slower timescales giving rise to a liquid-like behavior in the 
mesoscopic regime. The liquid-to-solid transition drives a rapid conversion of 
complex coacervates into heterotypic amyloids. Our results suggest that 
synergistic prion-α-synuclein interactions within condensates provide 
mechanistic underpinnings of their physiological role and overlapping 
neuropathological features.

Single molecule fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) 
are two very powerful techniques for the analysis of intrinsically disordered 
proteins (IDPs). Both techniques have individually made major contributions to 
deciphering the complex properties of IDPs and their interactions, and it has 
become evident that they can provide very complementary views on the 
distance-dynamics relationships of IDP systems. We now review the first 
approaches using both NMR and single molecule fluorescence to decipher the 
molecular properties of IDPs and their interactions. We shed light on how these 
two techniques were employed synergistically for multidomain proteins harboring 
intrinsically disordered linkers, for veritable IDPs, but also for liquid-liquid 
phase separated systems. Additionally, we provide insights into the first 
approaches to use single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and 
NMR for the description of multiconformational models of IDPs.

MOTIVATION: The compartmentalization of biochemical reactions, involved in the 
activation of gene expression in the eukaryotic nucleus, leads to the formation 
of membraneless bodies through liquid-liquid phase separation. These formations, 
called transcriptional condensates, appear to play important roles in gene 
regulation as they are assembled through the association of multiple enhancer 
regions in 3D genomic space. To date, we are still lacking efficient 
computational methodologies to identify the regions responsible for the 
formation of such condensates, based on genomic and conformational data.
RESULTS: In this work we present SEGCOND, a computational framework aiming to 
highlight genomic regions involved in the formation of transcriptional 
condensates. SEGCOND is flexible in combining multiple genomic datasets related 
to enhancer activity and chromatin accessibility, to perform a genome 
segmentation. It then uses this segmentation for the detection of highly 
transcriptionally active regions of the genome. At a final step, and through the 
integration of Hi-C data, it identifies regions of putative transcriptional 
condensates (PTC) as genomic domains where multiple enhancer elements coalesce 
in three-dimensional space. SEGCOND identifies a subset of enhancer segments 
with increased transcriptional activity. PTCs are also found to significantly 
overlap highly interconnected enhancer elements and super enhancers obtained 
through two independent approaches. Application of SEGCOND on data from a 
well-defined system of B-cell to macrophage transdifferentiation leads to the 
identification of previously unreported genes with a likely role in the process.

The cosolvent method has been widely used in the self-assembly of amphiphilic 
alternating copolymers (ACPs), but the role of good and selective solvents is 
rarely investigated. Here, we have developed a coarse-grained (CG) model for the 
widely studied thiol-epoxy-based amphiphilic ACPs and a three-bead CG model for 
tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the good solvent, which is compatible with the MARTINI 
water model. The accuracy of both the CG polymer and THF models was validated by 
reproducing the structural and thermodynamic properties obtained from 
experiments or atomistic simulation results. Density in bulk, the radius of 
gyration, and solvation free energy in water or THF showed a good agreement 
between CG and atomistic models. The CG models were further employed to explore 
the self-assembly of ACPs in THF/water mixtures with different compositions. 
Chain folding and liquid-liquid phase separation behaviors were found with 
increasing water fractions, which were the key steps of the self-assembly 
process. This work will provide a basic platform to explore the self-assembly of 
amphiphilic ACPs in solvent mixtures and to reveal the real role of different 
solvents in self-assembly.

Intrinsically disordered proteins or hybrid proteins with ordered domains and 
disordered regions (both collectively designated as IDP(R)s) defy the 
well-established structure-function paradigm due to their ability to perform 
multiple biological functions even in the absence of a well-defined 3D 
structure. IDP(R)s have a unique ability to exist as a functional heterogeneous 
ensemble, where they adopt multiple thermodynamically stable conformations with 
low energy barriers between states. The resultant structural plasticity or 
conformational adaptability provides them with a high functional diversity and 
ease of regulation. Hence, IDP(R)s are highly efficient biological machinery to 
mediate intricate cellular functions such as signaling, gene expression, and 
assembly of complex structures. One such structure is the nucleoprotein complex 
known as Chromatin. Interestingly, the proteins involved in shaping up the 
structure and function of chromatin are abundant in disordered regions, which 
serve more than just as mere flexible linkers. The disordered regions are 
involved in crucial processes such as gene expression regulation, chromatin 
architecture maintenance, and liquid-liquid phase separation initiation. This 
review is an attempt to explore the advantages and the functional and regulatory 
roles of intrinsic disorder in several Chromatin Associated Proteins from a 
mechanistic standpoint.

With the accumulation of massive data sets from high-throughput experiments and 
the rapid emergence of new types of omics data, gene sets have become more 
diverse and essential for the refinement of gene annotation at multidimensional 
levels. Accordingly, we collected and defined 236 007 gene sets across different 
categories for 44 plant species in the Plant Gene Set Annotation Database 
(PlantGSAD). These gene sets were divided into nine main categories covering 
many functional subcategories, such as trait ontology, co-expression modules, 
chromatin states, and liquid-liquid phase separation. The annotations from the 
collected gene sets covered all of the genes in the Brassicaceae species 
Arabidopsis and Poaceae species Oryza sativa. Several GSEA tools are implemented 
in PlantGSAD to improve the efficiency of the analysis, including custom SEA for 
a flexible strategy based on customized annotations, SEACOMPARE for the 
cross-comparison of SEA results, and integrated visualization features for 
ontological analysis that intuitively reflects their parent-child relationships. 
In summary, PlantGSAD provides numerous gene sets for multiple plant species and 
highly efficient analysis tools. We believe that PlantGSAD will become a 
multifunctional analysis platform that can be used to predict and elucidate the 
functions and mechanisms of genes of interest. PlantGSAD is publicly available 
at http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/PlantGSEAv2/.

Opalescence is a problem concerned with the stability of an antibody solution. 
It occurs when a high concentration of a protein is present. Arginine (Arg) is a 
versatile aggregation suppressor of proteins, which is among the candidates that 
suppress opalescence in antibody solutions. Here, we investigated the effect of 
various types of small molecular additives on opalescence to reveal the 
mechanism of Arg in preventing opalescence in antibody solution. As expected, 
Arg suppressed the opalescence of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) solution. Arg also 
concentration dependently inhibited the formation of microstructures in IgG 
molecules. Interestingly, the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of highly 
concentrated IgG solutions differed from those having low concentrations, even 
though IgG retained a distinct tertiary structure. Arginine ethylester was more 
effective in suppressing the opalescence of IgG solutions than Arg, whereas 
lysine and γ-guanidinobutyric acid were less effective. These results indicated 
that positively charged groups of both α-amine and guanidinium actively 
influence Arg as an additive for suppressing opalescence. Diols, which are the 
suppressors of the liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins were also 
effective in suppressing the opalescence. These results therefore provide 
insight into the control of opalescence of antibody solutions at high 
concentrations using solution additives.

Supramolecular assemblies of short peptides are experiencing a stimulating 
flowering. Herein, we report a novel class of bioinspired pentapeptides, not 
bearing Phe, that form hydrogels with fibrillar structures. The inherent 
sequence comes from the fragment 269-273 of nucleophosmin 1 protein, that is 
normally involved in liquid-liquid phase separation processes into the 
nucleolus. By means of rheology, spectroscopy, and scanning microscopy the 
crucial roles of the extremities in the modulation of the mechanical properties 
of hydrogels were elucidated. Three of four peptide showed a typical 
shear-thinning profile and a self-assembly into hierarchical nanostructures 
fibers and two of them resulted biocompatible in MCF7 cells. The presence of an 
amide group at C-terminal extremity caused the fastest aggregation and the major 
content of structured intermediates during gelling process. The tunable 
mechanical and structural features of this class of hydrogels render derived 
supramolecular systems versatile and suitable for future biomedical 
applications.

Protein condensates resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation have long been 
studied as bio-adhesives and coating materials for various applications. More 
recently, they are also being scrutinized as models for membraneless organelles 
in cells. Quantifying their interfacial mechanics and rheology at micrometer 
scales is vital for better understanding the physics underlying membraneless 
organelles in cells and for developing and improving technological applications 
of protein condensates. This study demonstrates how colloidal probe atomic force 
microscopy with an oscillating tip can be used to simultaneously investigate the 
interfacial mechanics and dynamic rheological properties of micro-scale protein 
condensates, formed via carefully controlled capillary condensation. This new 
approach can access oscillation frequencies ranging from 1 to 104 rad/s. By 
analyzing the data using an equivalent mechanical model, three characteristic 
frequency domains for the mechanics of micro-scale protein condensates are 
found: an interfacial tension-dominated domain at low frequencies, a transition 
domain (viscous-to-elastic crossover) at intermediate frequencies, and an 
elasticity-dominated domain at high frequencies, covering a broad range of time 
scales relevant in biology and technological applications of protein 
condensates.

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is an important phenomenon in biology, and 
it is desirable to develop quantitative methods to analyze protein droplets 
generated by LLPS. This study quantified the change in protein concentration in 
a droplet in label-free and single-droplet conditions using Raman imaging and 
the Raman band of water as an intensity standard. Small changes in the protein 
concentration with variations in pH and salt concentration were observed, and it 
was shown that the concentration in the droplet decreases as the conditions 
become less favorable for droplet formation. The effect of exposure to 
1,6-hexanediol was also examined, and this additive was found to decrease the 
protein concentration in the droplet. A model can be proposed in which the 
addition of 1,6-hexanediol reduces the protein concentration in the droplet, and 
the droplet disappears when the concentration falls below a certain threshold 
value.

Intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) plays an important role in liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS). RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a 
well-studied IDP that induces LLPS since its low-complexity core region 
(FUS-LC-core) is essential for droplet formation through contacts between 
FUS-LC-cores. Several experimental studies have reported that adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) concentrations modulate LLPS-driven droplet formation through 
the dissolution of FUS. To elucidate the role of ATP in this dissolution, 
microsecond-order all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed 
for a crowded system of FUS-LC-cores in the presence of multiple ATP molecules. 
Our analysis revealed that the adenine group of ATP frequently contacted the 
FUS-LC-core, and the phosphoric acid group of ATP was exposed to the external 
solvent, which promoted both hydration and solubilization of FUS.

Membrane-less scenarios that involve liquid-liquid phase separation 
(coacervation) provide clues for how protocells might emerge. Here, we report a 
versatile approach to construct coacervates by mixing fatty acid with 
biomolecule dopamine as the protocell model. The coacervate droplets are easily 
formed over a wide range of concentrations. The solutes with different 
interaction characteristics, including cationic, anionic, and hydrophobic dyes, 
can be well concentrated within the coacervates. In addition, reversible 
self-assemblies of the coacervates can be controlled by concentration, pH, 
temperature, salinity, and bioreaction realizing cycles between 
compartmentalization and noncompartmentalization. Through in situ dopamine 
polymerization, the stability of coacervate droplets is significantly improved, 
leading to higher resistance toward external factors. Therefore, the coacervates 
based on fatty acid and dopamine could serve as a bottom-up membrane-less 
protocell model that provides the links between the simple (small molecule) and 
complex (macromolecule) systems in the process of cell evolution.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome 
and is usually caused by mutations in the neurofibromin 2 (NF2) gene, which 
encodes a tumor suppressor and initiates the Hippo pathway. However, the 
mechanism by which NF2 functions in the Hippo pathway isn't fully understood. 
Here we identified a NF2 c.770-784del mutation from a neurofibromatosis type 2 
family. MD simulations showed that this mutation significantly changed the 
structure of the F3 module of the NF2-FERM domain. Functional assays indicated 
that the NF2 c.770-784del variant formed LLPS in the cytoplasm with LATS to 
restrain LATS plasma membrane localization and inactivated the Hippo pathway. 
Besides, this deletion partly caused a skipping of exon 8 and reduced the 
protein level of NF2, collectively promoting proliferation and tumorigenesis of 
meningeal cells. We identified an unrecognized mechanism of LLPS and splicing 
skipping for the NF2-induced Hippo pathway, which provided new insight into the 
pathogenesis of neurofibromatosis type 2.

Upon stress challenges, proteins/RNAs undergo liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) to fine-tune cell physiology and metabolism to help cells adapt to 
adverse environments. The formation of LLPS has been recently linked with 
intracellular pH, and maintaining proper intracellular pH homeostasis is known 
to be essential for the survival of organisms. However, organisms are constantly 
exposed to diverse stresses, which are accompanied by alterations in the 
intracellular pH. Aging processes and human diseases are also intimately linked 
with intracellular pH alterations. In this review, we summarize stress-, aging-, 
and cancer-associated pH changes together with the mechanisms by which cells 
regulate cytosolic pH homeostasis. How critical cell components undergo LLPS in 
response to pH alterations is also discussed, along with the functional roles of 
intracellular pH fluctuation in the regulation of LLPS. Further studies 
investigating the interplay of pH with other stressors in LLPS regulation and 
identifying protein responses to different pH levels will provide an in-depth 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying pH-driven LLPS in cell adaptation. 
Moreover, deciphering aging and disease-associated pH changes that influence 
LLPS condensate formation could lead to a deeper understanding of the functional 
roles of biomolecular condensates in aging and aging-related diseases.

Molecular dynamics simulations play an increasingly important role in the 
rational design of (nano)-materials and in the study of biomacromolecules. 
However, generating input files and realistic starting coordinates for these 
simulations is a major bottleneck, especially for high throughput protocols and 
for complex multi-component systems. To eliminate this bottleneck, we present 
the polyply software suite that provides 1) a multi-scale graph matching 
algorithm designed to generate parameters quickly and for arbitrarily complex 
polymeric topologies, and 2) a generic multi-scale random walk protocol capable 
of setting up complex systems efficiently and independent of the target 
force-field or model resolution. We benchmark quality and performance of the 
approach by creating realistic coordinates for polymer melt simulations, 
single-stranded as well as circular single-stranded DNA. We further demonstrate 
the power of our approach by setting up a microphase-separated block copolymer 
system, and by generating a liquid-liquid phase separated system inside a lipid 
vesicle.

Ramonda serbica Panc. is an ancient resurrection plant able to survive a long 
desiccation period and recover metabolic functions upon watering. The 
accumulation of protective late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEAPs) is a 
desiccation tolerance hallmark. To propose their role in R. serbica desiccation 
tolerance, we structurally characterised LEAPs and evaluated LEA gene expression 
levels in hydrated and desiccated leaves. By integrating de novo transcriptomics 
and homologues LEAP domains, 318 R. serbica LEAPs were identified and classified 
according to their conserved motifs and phylogeny. The in silico analysis 
revealed that hydrophilic LEA4 proteins exhibited an exceptionally high tendency 
to form amphipathic α-helices. The most abundant, atypical LEA2 group contained 
more hydrophobic proteins predicted to fold into the defined globular domains. 
Within the desiccation-upregulated LEA genes, the majority encoded highly 
disordered DEH1, LEA1, LEA4.2, and LEA4.3 proteins, while the greatest portion 
of downregulated genes encoded LEA2.3 and LEA2.5 proteins. While dehydrins might 
chelate metals and bind DNA under water deficit, other intrinsically disordered 
LEAPs might participate in forming intracellular proteinaceous condensates or 
adopt amphipathic α-helical conformation, enabling them to stabilise 
desiccation-sensitive proteins and membranes. This comprehensive LEAPs 
structural characterisation is essential to understanding their function and 
regulation during desiccation aiming at crop drought tolerance improvement.

ultrasonic extraction, solid-phase extraction, liquid chromatography, and tandem 
mass spectrometry.

Corticosteroids (CSs) are widely used to treat various inflammatory and immune 
diseases in humans and animals, such as arthritis and lupus. Thus far, CSs have 
been frequently detected in diverse pollution sources, such as in the influent 
and effluent of traditional wastewater treatment plants, livestock farms, and 
aquaculture. Owing to incomplete removal or limited treatment, CSs can enter the 
water environment and eventually be adsorbed in the sediment. Due to 
hydrodynamic effects, CSs can re-enter the surface water through the 
resuspension of sediments, and pose a hazard to the ecosystem and human health 
via the enrichment of aquatic organisms and transmission through the food chain. 
Therefore, trace analysis of CSs in sediments is significant for exploring their 
prevalence and behavior in multiple environments. However, existing research 
mainly focuses on the determination of glucocorticoids in water samples, and 
studies on the systematic quantitative analysis of CSs in environmental solid 
samples with more complex matrices are scarce. Moreover, majority of previous 
investigations focused on a limited number of glucocorticoids, making it 
important to widen the range of target compounds to be studied, including 
mineralocorticoids. In this study, the main factors which could influence the 
accuracy and sensitivity in the determination of 24 target CSs were 
systematically optimized in the sample pretreatment and instrument analysis. A 
novel method based on ultrasonic extraction coupled with solid phase extraction 
(SPE) for sample pretreatment was developed for the simultaneous determination 
of the 24 CSs in sediments using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The sediment sample was ground to homogenize the 
particle sizes after freeze-drying. The analytes from 2.0 g of the sample were 
ultrasonicated and extracted with methanol-acetone (1∶1, v/v). After 
concentrating and diluting each extract, SPE was performed. The water sample was 
extracted and purified using hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) cartridges, 
following which the extract was further purified with LC-NH2 cartridges. The 
extracts were concentrated using a rotary evaporator, dried under a gentle 
stream of nitrogen, and re-dissolved in methanol for instrumental analysis. 
Chromatographic separation was conducted on an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C8 
column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 1.8 μm), with a column flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and a 
gradient of mobile phases A (water with 0.1% acetic acid) and B (acetonitrile). 
The column temperature was set to 30 ℃ and the injection volume was fixed at 5 
μL. Electrospray ionization MS in the dynamic multiple reaction monitoring 
(DMRM) and selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes were performed in the positive 
mode for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the target compounds. 
Quantitation of the target compounds was carried out using the internal standard 
method. The effects of different extraction solvents, purification conditions, 
and MS conditions on the recoveries of the target compounds were investigated. 
The limits of detection (LODs) (S/N≥3) and limits of quantification (LOQs) 
(S/N≥10) of all 24 compounds were in the ranges of 0.14-1.25 μg/kg and 0.26-2.26 
μg/kg, respectively. The correlation coefficients of linear calibration curves 
were higher than 0.995 in the range of 1.0-100 μg/L. The recoveries of the 24 
CSs at 5, 20, and 50 μg/kg spiked levels ranged from 64.9% to 125.1% with 
relative standard deviations of 0.4%-12.6% (n=5). The developed method was 
applied to analyze the CSs in three sediment samples from the rivers of the 
Pearl River Delta. In all, 11 target compounds were detected in these samples, 
with contents in the range of 1.25-29.38 μg/kg. The characteristic of this 
method is efficient, sensitive, reliable, and suitable for the trace 
determination of varieties of natural and synthesized CSs in environmental 
sediments.

沉积物中皮质类固醇激素(CSs)的痕量分析对探究其在环境多介质中的赋存状况和环境行为具有重要意义。然而目前相关研究主要集中在水样中糖皮质激素的测定,对基质更为复杂的环境固体样品中CSs的定量分析研究仍十分有限亦缺乏针对性、系统性,且目标物未能覆盖大多数常见常用的糖/盐CSs。本研究系统地优化了样品前处理过程和仪器分析中影响24种CSs测定准确性和灵敏度的条件,建立了采用超声波提取联合固相萃取技术对样品进行前处理,利用超高效液相色谱-串联质谱(UPLC-MS/MS)同时测定沉积物中24种CSs的分析方法。沉积物经冷冻干燥、研磨后,取2.0

S/N≥3)和定量限(LOQ, S/N≥10)分别为0.14~1.25 μg/kg和0.26~2.26 μg/kg,工作曲线在1.0~100 
μg/L范围内具有良好的线性关系(R2>0.995)。在5、20、50 
μg/kg的基质加标水平下,24种CSs的平均回收率为64.9%~125.1%,相对标准偏差为0.4%~12.6%(n=5)。应用该方法测定了3份珠江三角洲河流沉积物,其中有11种目标物被检出,含量范围为1.25~29.38 
μg/kg。该方法净化效率高,灵敏可靠,适用于环境沉积物中多种天然和合成CSs的痕量检测。

Nuclear-import receptors (NIRs) engage nuclear-localization signals (NLSs) of 
polypeptides in the cytoplasm and transport these cargo across the 
size-selective barrier of the nuclear-pore complex into the nucleoplasm. Beyond 
this canonical role in nuclear transport, NIRs operate in the cytoplasm to 
chaperone and disaggregate NLS-bearing clients. Indeed, NIRs can inhibit and 
reverse functional and deleterious phase transitions of their cargo, including 
several prominent neurodegenerative disease-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) 
with prion-like domains (PrLDs), such as TDP-43, FUS, EWSR1, TAF15, hnRNPA1, and 
hnRNPA2. Importantly, elevated NIR expression can mitigate degenerative 
phenotypes connected to aberrant cytoplasmic aggregation of RBPs with PrLDs. 
Here, we review recent discoveries that NIRs can also antagonize aberrant 
interactions and toxicity of arginine-rich, dipeptide-repeat proteins that are 
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD) caused by G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the first intron of 
C9ORF72. We also highlight recent findings that multiple NIR family members can 
prevent and reverse liquid-liquid phase separation of specific clients bearing 
RGG motifs in an NLS-independent manner. Finally, we discuss strategies to 
enhance NIR activity or expression, which could have therapeutic utility for 
several neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS, FTD, multisystem 
proteinopathy, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, 
tauopathies, and related diseases.

Liquid-liquid phase-separated coacervate droplets give rise to membraneless 
compartments that play an important role in the spatial organization and 
reactivity in cells. Due to their molecularly crowded nature and ability to 
sequester biomolecules, coacervate droplets create distinct environments for 
enzymatic reaction kinetics and reaction mechanisms that markedly differ from 
bulk solution. In this work, we use a combination of experiments and 
quantitative modeling to understand how coacervate droplets promote reversible 
small molecule reaction chemistry. In particular, we study a model condensation 
reaction generating an unstable fluorescent imine in polyacrylic 
acid-polyethylene glycol coacervate droplets over a range of conditions. At 
equilibrium, the concentration of the imine product in coacervate droplets is 
approximately 140-fold larger than that in bulk solution, which arises due to 
preferential partitioning of reactants and products into coacervate droplets and 
a reaction equilibrium constant that is roughly threefold larger in coacervate 
droplets than in solution. A reaction-diffusion model is developed to 
quantitatively describe how competing reaction and partitioning equilibria 
govern the spatial distribution of the imine product inside coacervate droplets. 
Overall, our results show that compartmentalization stabilizes kinetically 
labile reaction products, which enables larger reactant concentrations in 
coacervate droplets compared to bulk solution. Broadly, these results provide an 
improved understanding of how biomolecular condensates promote multistep 
reaction pathways involving unstable reaction intermediates and suggest how 
coacervates provide a potential abiotic mechanism to promote molecular 
complexity.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is considered to be a 
cellular counterpart of learning and memory. Activation of postsynaptic NMDA 
type glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) induces trafficking of AMPA type glutamate 
receptors (AMPA-R) and other proteins to the synapse in sequential fashion. At 
the same time, the dendritic spine expands for long-term and modulation of actin 
underlies this (structural LTP or sLTP). How these changes persist despite 
constant diffusion and turnover of the component proteins have been the central 
focus of the current LTP research. Signaling triggered by Ca2+-influx via NMDA-R 
triggers kinase including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). 
CaMKII can sustain longer-term biochemical signaling by forming a 
reciprocally-activating kinase-effector complex with its substrate proteins 
including Tiam1, thereby regulating persistence of the downstream signaling. 
Furthermore, activated CaMKII can condense at the synapse through the mechanism 
of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This increases the binding capacity at 
the synapse, thereby contributing to the maintenance of enlarged protein 
complexes. It may also serve as the synapse tag, which captures newly 
synthesized proteins.

Copanlisib is a dual PI3K-δ inhibitor, being used in follicular lymphoma 
treatment. In this research, we report a validated LC-MS/MS method for 
quantifying copanlisib from mouse dried blood spot (DBS). We validated the 
method in-line with the FDA. Liquid-liquid extraction technique was used to 
extract copanlisib from the DBS discs. We used an Atlantis dC18 column and 
isocratic mobile phase for the chromatographic separation of copanlisib and the 
internal standard (idelalisib). The flow was 0.90 mL/min. In the optimized 
chromatographic conditions, the retention of copanlisib and the internal 
standard was 0.98 and 0.93 min, respectively. Each injection total run time was 
2.50 min. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 481.31→128.00 and 
416.10→176.10 for copanlisib and the internal standard (IS) idelalisib, 
respectively. We have used a broad calibration range (1.01-4797 ng/mL) with a 
determination coefficient (r2 ) of 0.997. All the evaluated parameters met the 
acceptance criteria. Haematocrit did not influence DBS copanlisib 
concentrations. We have used the validated method to derive the intravenous 
pharmacokinetic parameters by quantifying copanlisib in mouse plasma.

Recent experiments suggested that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can regulate 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of various proteins and inhibit protein 
aggregations at its physiological concentration, which is highly correlated with 
the nonspecific interactions of ATP to a wide variety of proteins. However, the 
mechanism underlying the general binding capability of ATP largely remains 
unclear. In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulation to study the 
binding of ATPs to three proteins with distinct net charges: TDP-43 NTD (-7 e), 
TAF15-RRM (0 e), HWEL (+8 e). Negatively charged ATP exhibits a strong trend to 
accumulate around all of these proteins. While only a fraction of the 
accumulated ATPs directly binds to the limited regions of the protein surface, 
additional ATPs indirectly bind to proteins by aggregating into ATP clusters. 
Hence, the proportion of the directly bound ATPs in the clusters as well as 
their binding regions can be adjusted in response to different proteins, which 
makes ATP well adapted to a variety of proteins. Moreover, our results suggest 
that ATP tightly binds to Arg with high affinity, and Arg dominates the direct 
binding of ATP. Meanwhile, Arg also affects the self-association of accumulated 
ATPs. The size of the ATP cluster is effectively regulated by the distribution 
of Arg. Considering the ubiquity of Arg in proteins, our findings are helpful to 
understand the general binding capability of ATP.

Rigid, solid-state components represent the current paradigm for electronic 
systems, but they lack post-production reconfigurability and pose 
ever-increasing challenges to efficient end-of-life recycling. Liquid 
electronics may overcome these limitations by offering flexible in-the-field 
redesign and separation at end-of-life via simple liquid phase chemistries. Up 
to now, preliminary work on liquid electronics has focused on liquid metal 
components, but these devices still require an encapsulating polymer and 
typically use alloys of rare elements like indium. Here, using the self-assembly 
of jammed two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3 C2 Tx ) MXene nanoparticles at 
liquid-liquid interfaces, we describe "all-liquid" electrically conductive 
sheets, wires, and simple functional devices including electromechanical 
switches and photodetectors. These assemblies combine the high conductivity of 
MXene nanosheets with the controllable form and reconfigurability of structured 
liquids. Such configurations could have applications not only in electronics, 
but also in catalysis and microfluidics, especially in systems where the product 
and substrate have affinity for solvents of differing polarity. This article is

Many biomolecular condensates, including nucleoli and stress granules, form via 
dynamic multivalent protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. These 
molecular interactions nucleate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and 
determine condensate properties, such as size and fluidity. Here, we outline the 
experimental procedures for single-molecule fluorescence experiments to probe 
protein-RNA interactions underlying LLPS. The experiments include 
single-molecule Förster (Fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to 
monitor protein-induced conformational changes in the RNA, protein-induced 
fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) to measure protein-RNA encounters, and 
single-molecule nucleation experiments to quantify the association and buildup 
of proteins on a nucleating RNA. Together, these experiments provide 
complementary approaches to elucidate a molecular view of the protein-RNA 
interactions that drive ribonucleoprotein condensate formation.

Harmonin is a protein containing multiple PDZ domains and is required for the 
development and maintenance of hair cell stereocilia and brush border 
microvilli. Mutations in the USH1C gene can cause Usher syndrome type 1C, a 
severe inheritable disease characterized by the loss of hearing and vision. 
Here, by solving the high-resolution crystal structure of Harmonin PDZ2 and 
coiled-coil domains in a complex with the tail of cadherin-related family member 
2, we demonstrated that mutations located in the Harmonin PDZ2 domain and found 
in patients could affect its stability, and thus, the target binding capability. 
The structure also implies that the coiled-coil domain could form antiparallel 
dimers under high concentrations, possibly when Harmonin underwent liquid-liquid 
phase separation in the upper tip-link density in hair cell stereocilia or 
microvilli of enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium. The crystal structure, 
together with the biochemical analysis, provided mechanistic implications for 
Harmonin mutations causing Usher syndrome, non-syndromic deafness, or 
enteropathy.

The use of templates in materials chemistry is a well-established approach for 
producing membrane-bounded hollow spheres used for microencapsulation 
applications, but also in synthetic biology to assemble artificial cell-like 
compartments. Sacrificial solid or gel micro-particles, but also liquid-like 
oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion droplets are routinely used as templates 
to produce capsules. Yet, disruption of the core sacrificial material often 
requires harsh experimental conditions, such as organic solvents, which limits 
the use of such approach to encapsulate fragile solutes, including biomolecules. 
Recently, water-in-water emulsion droplets have emerged as promising alternative 
templates to produce capsules in solvent-free conditions. These water-in-water 
droplets result from liquid-liquid phase separation in dilute aqueous polymer or 
surfactants solutions. Their ease of preparation, the large palette of 
components they can be assembled from and the lack of harsh solvent or oil used 
for their production make water-in-water emulsions of practical importance in 
materials chemistry. Water-in-water droplets can also spontaneously sequester 
solutes by equilibrium partitioning, which provides a simple strategy to locally 
accumulate molecules of interest and encapsulate them in capsules after 
interfacial shell formation. Here, we review recent works that employ 
water-in-water emulsion droplets to prepare capsules and suggest possible 
additional applications in materials chemistry.

Phase transitions have an essential role in the assembly of nature's 
protein-based materials into hierarchically organized structures, yet many of 
the underlying mechanisms and interactions remain to be resolved. A central 
question for designing proteins for materials is how the protein architecture 
and sequence affects the nature of the phase transitions and resulting assembly. 
In this work, we produced 82 kDa (1×), 143 kDa (2×), and 204 kDa (3×) 
silk-mimicking proteins by taking advantage of protein ligation by 
SpyCatcher/Tag protein-peptide pair. We show that the three silk proteins all 
undergo a phase transition from homogeneous solution to assembly formation. In 
the assembly phase, a length- and concentration-dependent transition between two 
distinct assembly morphologies, one forming aggregates and another coacervates, 
exists. The coacervates showed properties that were dependent on the protein 
size. Computational modeling of the proteins by a bead-spring model supports the 
experimental results and provides us a possible mechanistic origin for the 
assembly transitions based on architectures and interactions.

The π-π interaction is a major driving force that stabilizes protein assemblies 
during protein folding. Recent studies have additionally demonstrated its 
involvement in the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of intrinsically 
disordered proteins (IDPs). As the participating residues in IDPs are exposed to 
water, π-π interactions for LLPS must be modeled in water, as opposed to the 
interactions that are often established at the hydrophobic domains of folded 
proteins. Thus, we investigated the association of free energies of benzene and 
phenol dimers in water by integrating van der Waals (vdW)-corrected density 
functional theory (DFT) and DFT in classical explicit solvents (DFT-CES). By 
comparing the vdW-corrected DFT and DFT-CES results with high-level wavefunction 
calculations and experimental solvation free energies, respectively, we 
established the quantitative credibility of these approaches, enabling a 
reliable prediction of the benzene and phenol dimer association free energies in 
water. We discovered that solvation influences dimer association free energies, 
but not significantly when no direct hydrogen-bond-type interaction exists 
between two monomeric units, which can be explained by the enthalpy-entropy 
compensation. Our comprehensive computational study of the solvation effect on 
π-π interactions in water could help us understand the molecular-level driving 
mechanism underlying the IDP phase behaviors.

Bisphenol A (or BPA) is a toxic endocrine disrupting chemical that is released 
into the environment through modern manufacturing practices. BPA can disrupt the 
production, function and activity of endogenous hormones causing irregularity in 
the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal glands and also the pituitary-adrenal 
function. BPA has immuno-suppression activity and can downregulate T cells and 
antioxidant genes. The genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of BPA is paramount and 
therefore, there is an immediate need to properly detect and remediate its 
influence. In this review, we discuss the toxic effects of BPA on different 
metabolic systems in the human body, followed by its mechanism of action. 
Various novel detection techniques (LC-MS, GC-MS, capillary electrophoresis, 
immunoassay and sensors) involving a pretreatment step (liquid-liquid 
microextraction and molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction) have also been 
detailed. Mechanisms of various remediation strategies, including biodegradation 
using native enzymes, membrane separation processes, photocatalytic oxidation, 
use of nanosorbents and thermal degradation has been detailed. An overview of 
the global regulations pertaining to BPA has been presented. More investigations 
are required on the efficiency of integrated remediation technologies rather 
than standalone methods for BPA removal. The effect of processing operations on 
BPA in food matrices is also warranted to restrict its transport into food 
products.

Biomolecular condensates present in cells can fundamentally affect the 
aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins and play a role in the regulation of this 
process. While liquid-liquid phase separation of amyloidogenic proteins by 
themselves can act as an alternative nucleation pathway, interaction of partly 
disordered aggregation-prone proteins with preexisting condensates that act as 
localization centers could be a far more general mechanism of altering their 
aggregation behavior. Here, we show that so-called host biomolecular condensates 
can both accelerate and slow down amyloid formation. We study the amyloidogenic 
protein α-synuclein and two truncated α-synuclein variants in the presence of 
three types of condensates composed of nonaggregating peptides, RNA, or ATP. Our 
results demonstrate that condensates can markedly speed up amyloid formation 
when proteins localize to their interface. However, condensates can also 
significantly suppress aggregation by sequestering and stabilizing amyloidogenic 
proteins, thereby providing living cells with a possible protection mechanism 
against amyloid formation.

Artificial organelles are microcompartments capable of performing catalytic 
reactions in living cells to replace absent or lost cellular functions. 
Coacervate microdroplets, formed via liquid-liquid phase separation, have been 
developed as membraneless organelles that mimic the dynamical organization of 
liquid organelles. However, the further studies focusing on cellular implanting 
of coacervate microdroplets in living cells to supplement the dysfunction of 
natural cells are still rare. Here catalase (CAT)-containing coacervate 
microdroplets, developed as artificial membraneless organelles with unique 
liquid compartments, were integrated into living cells to scavenge intracellular 
massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and recover cell viability. The 
enzyme-containing coacervate microdroplets were constructed by sequestering CAT 
in poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDDA)/polyacrylic acid (PAA) 
coacervate microdroplets; their liquid-like fluidity was revealed by 
fluorescence recovery after bleaching, and coalescence experiment in vitro and 
in living cells. After cellular internalization, the coacervate microdroplets 
remained in the polymer-rich dense phase and retained enzymatic activities. 
CAT-mediated H2O2 removal and ROS scavenging in living cells decreased the 
cytotoxicity of H2O2, improving cell viability. The cell internalization of 
coacervate microdroplets in vitro provides a novel approach for designing 
artificial membraneless organelles in living cells. The strategy of using 
artificial organelle-mediated enzymatic reactions to supplement cellular 
dysfunctions can be exploited for their further biomedical applications.

The methods for hydrogen yield efficiency improvements, the gaseous stream 
purification in gaseous biofuels generation, and the biomass pretreatment are 
considered as the main trends in research devoted to gaseous biofuel production. 
The environmental aspect related to the liquid stream purification arises. 
Moreover, the management of post-fermentation broth with the application of 
various biorefining techniques gains importance. Chemical compounds occurring in 
the exhausted liquid phase after biomass pretreatment and subsequent dark and 
photo fermentation processes are considered as value-added by products. The most 
valuable are furfural (FF), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and levulinic acid 
(LA). Enriching their solutions can be carried with the application of 
liquid-liquid extraction with the use of a suitable solvent. In these studies, 
hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were tested as extractants. The 
screening of 56 DESs was carried out using the Conductor-like Screening Model 
for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS). DESs which exposed the highest inhibitory effect 
on fermentation and negligible water solubility were prepared. The LA, FF, and 
HMF were analyzed using FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the basic 
physicochemical properties of DES were carefully studied. In the second part of 
the paper, deep eutectic solvents were used for the extraction of FF, LA, and 
HMF from post-fermentation broth (PFB). The main extraction parameters, i.e., 
temperature, pH, and DES: PFB volume ratio (VDES:VPFB), were optimized by means 
of a Box-Behnken design model. Two approaches have been proposed for extraction 
process. In the first approach, DES was used as a solvent. In the second, one of 
the DES components was added to the sample, and DES was generated in situ. To 
enhance the post-fermentation broth management, optimization of the parameters 
promoting HMF, FF, and LA extraction was carried under real conditions. 
Moreover, the antimicrobial effect of the extraction of FF, HMF, and LA was 
investigated to define the possibility of simultaneous separation of microbial 
parts and denatured peptides via precipitation.

A simple, rapid, sensitive and specific gas chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was developed for quantitation of salbutamol in 
human urine using salbutamol-d3 as the internal standard. The processing of 
urines samples includes deconjugation with enzymatic hydrolysis, solid phase 
extraction procedure utilizing XAD2 column and liquid-liquid extraction 
accompanied by the derivatization by means of MSTFA/IODO-TMS/DTE mixture. The GC 
column was a HP Ultra-1 (17 m × 0.22 mm × 0.11 μm) used to separate the peak of 
interest. The data for GC-MS/MS were acquired and processed utilizing GC Labs 
Solution and Insight GCMS Software. The detection of spectra was performed on TQ 
8050. This method included a chromatographic run of 13.67 min and the linearity 
was found over the concentration range of 250-2000 ng/mL with a regression 
coefficient (r2) of 0.99. The coefficient of variation for intra and interday 
assay precision was between 1.85 and 2.85% and the accuracy was between 95.50 
and 107.04% for low quality control (QC), medium QC and high QC. The recovery 
was adequate to reliable detect the analyte at or below the level recommended by 
the World Anti-Doping Agency i.e., threshold 1000 ng/mL. The limit of detection 
and limit of quantification were found to be 10 and 100 ng/mL, respectively. The 
expanded measurement uncertainty (Uexp%) was found to be 8.28%.

Contezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic with good antibacterial activity 
against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus. For the purpose to further characterize the pharmacokinetics of 
contezolid and its major metabolite M2, accurate and rapid ultra-performance 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assays (UPLC-MS/MS) were 
developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of contezolid and M2 in 
human plasma and urine. The plasma samples were pretreated by liquid-liquid 
extraction. The automated solid phase extraction method was used to preprocess 
urine samples. ACQUITY UPLC® BEH C8 (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) column was used to 
separate the analytes with a gradient mobile phase of acetonitrile and water at 
a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The calibration curves showed good linearity over the 
concentration ranges of 0.0100-5.00 µg/mL for contezolid in plasma and urine, 
0.00200-1.00 µg/mL in plasma and 0.0200-10.0 µg/mL in urine for M2, 
respectively. For both plasma and urine assays, the intra- and inter-batch 
accuracy and precision were within 15% for all quality control levels, including 
the lower limit of quantitation. The methods were fully validated and 
successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of contezolid tablets in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.

Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft 
materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from 
the mesoscale kinetically trapped non-equilibrium state, which governs device 
charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) has been 
revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its 
chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non-fullerene OPVs, RSoXS 
analysis near the carbon K-edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity 
of the materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by 
nitrogen K-edge RSoXS (NK-RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational 
contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for 
determination of phase separation. NK-RSoXS clearly visualizes the combined 
feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid-liquid demixing, 
while PM6:Y6:Y6-BO ternary blends with reduced phase-separation size and 
enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. 
Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the 
strong and directional N 1s → π* resonances make NK-RSoXS a powerful tool to 
uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand 
heterogeneous systems.

The regular functioning of the nucleolus and nucleus-mitochondria crosstalk are 
considered unrelated processes, yet cytochrome c (Cc) migrates to the nucleus 
and even the nucleolus under stress conditions. Nucleolar liquid-liquid phase 
separation usually serves the cell as a fast, smart mechanism to control the 
spatial localization and trafficking of nuclear proteins. Actually, the 
alternative reading frame (ARF), a tumor suppressor protein sequestered by 
nucleophosmin (NPM) in the nucleoli, is shifted out from NPM upon DNA damage. 
DNA damage also triggers early translocation of respiratory Cc to nucleus before 
cytoplasmic caspase activation. Here, we show that Cc can bind to nucleolar NPM 
by triggering an extended-to-compact conformational change, driving ARF release. 
Such a NPM-Cc nucleolar interaction can be extended to a general mechanism for 
DNA damage in which the lysine-rich regions of Cc-rather than the canonical, 
arginine-rich stretches of membrane-less organelle components-controls the 
trafficking and availability of nucleolar proteins.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are among the most abundant immune cells in 
the tumor microenvironment and are important mediators of tumor development and 
progression. Here, we identified a macrophage-associated long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA), MALR, that facilitates progression of esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC). TAM-mediated secretion of TNFα drove MALR upregulation in ESCC 
cells. MALR promoted aerobic glycolytic activity and facilitated angiogenesis by 
activating the HIF1α signaling pathway. Mechanistically, MALR bound the dsRBD1 
domain of interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3), promoting ILF3 protein 
stability and ILF3-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), thereby 
enhancing HIF1α mRNA stability by preventing PARN-mediated degradation. Loss of 
MALR suppressed cell line-based and patient-derived xenograft tumor growth. 
Clinically, high expression of MALR positively correlated with HIF1α target gene 
expression and indicated poor prognoses for esophageal cancer patients. Overall, 
this study uncovers the physiological roles of MALR/ILF3-mediated LLPS in tumor 
microenvironment remodeling, highlighting the MALR-ILF3-HIF1α axis as a 
potential target for cancer therapy.

OBJECTIVES: YTHDF1 is known as a m6 A reader protein, and many researches of 
YTHDF1 focused on the regulation of mRNA translation efficiency. However, YTHDF1 
is also related to RNA degradation, but how YTHDF1 regulates mRNA degradation is 
indefinite. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) underlies the formation of 
membraneless compartments in mammal cells, and there are few reports focused on 
the correlation of RNA degradation with LLPS. In this research, we focused on 
the mechanism of YTHDF1 degraded mRNA through LLPS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CRISPR/Cas9 knock out system was used to establish 
the YTHDF1 knock out (YTHDF1-KO) cell lines (HEK293 and HeLa) and METTL14 knock 
out (METTL14-KO) cell line (HEK293). 4SU-TT-seq was used to check the half-life 
changes of mRNAs. Actinomycin D and qPCR were used to test the half-life changes 
of individual mRNA. RNA was stained with SYTO RNA-select dye in wild type (WT) 
and YTHDF1-KO HeLa cell lines. Co-localization of YTHDF1 and AGO2 was identified 
by immunofluorescence. The interaction domain of YTHDF1 and AGO2 was identified 
by western blot. Phase separation of YTHDF1 was performed in vitro and in vivo. 
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed on droplets as 
an assessment of their liquidity.
RESULTS: In this research, we found that deletion of YTHDF1 led to massive RNA 
patches deposited in cytoplasm. The results of 4SU-TT-seq showed that deletion 
of YTHDF1 would prolong the half-life of mRNAs. Immunofluorescence data showed 
that YTHDF1 and AGO2 could co-localize in P-body, and Co-IP results showed that 
YTHDF1 could interact with AGO2 through YT521-B homology (YTH) domain. We 
confirmed that YTHDF1 could undergo phase separation in vitro and in vivo, and 
compared with AGO2, YTHDF1 was more important in P-body formation. The FRAP 
results showed that liquid AGO2 droplets would convert to gel/solid when YTHDF1 
was deleted. As AGO2 plays important roles in miRISCs, we also found that 
miRNA-mediate mRNA degradation is related to YTHDF1.
CONCLUSIONS: YTHDF1 recruits AGO2 through the YTH domain. YTHDF1 degrades 
targeting mRNAs by promoting P-body formation through LLPS. The deletion of 
YTHDF1 causes the P-body to change from liquid droplets to gel/solid droplets, 
and form AGO2/RNA patches, resulting in a degradation delay of mRNAs. These 
findings reveal a previously unrecognized crosstalk between YTHDF1 and AGO2, 
raising a new sight of mRNA post-transcriptional regulation by YTHDF1.

Artificial cells are minimal structures constructed from biomolecular building 
blocks designed to mimic cellular processes, behaviors, and architectures. One 
near-ubiquitous feature of cellular life is the spatial organization of internal 
content. We know from biology that organization of content (including in 
membrane-bound organelles) is linked to cellular functions and that this feature 
is dynamic: the presence, location, and degree of compartmentalization changes 
over time. Vesicle-based artificial cells, however, are not currently able to 
mimic this fundamental cellular property. Here, we describe an artificial cell 
design strategy that addresses this technological bottleneck. We create a series 
of artificial cell architectures which possess multicompartment assemblies 
localized either on the inner or on the outer surface of the artificial cell 
membrane. Exploiting liquid-liquid phase separation, we can also engineer 
spatially segregated regions of condensed subcompartments attached to the cell 
surface, aligning with coexisting membrane domains. These structures can sense 
changes in environmental conditions and respond by reversibly transitioning from 
condensed multicompartment layers on the membrane surface to a dispersed state 
in the cell lumen, mimicking the dynamic compartmentalization found in 
biological cells. Likewise, we engineer exosome-like subcompartments that can be 
released to the environment. We can achieve this by using two types of triggers: 
chemical (addition of salts) and mechanical (by pulling membrane tethers using 
optical traps). These approaches allow us to control the compartmentalization 
state of artificial cells on population and single-cell levels.

Chemical modifications of RNA molecules regulate both RNA metabolism and fate. 
The deposition and function of these modifications are mediated by the actions 
of writer, reader, and eraser proteins. At the cellular level, RNA modifications 
regulate several cellular processes including cell death, proliferation, 
senescence, differentiation, migration, metabolism, autophagy, the DNA damage 
response, and liquid-liquid phase separation. Emerging evidence demonstrates 
that RNA modifications play active roles in the physiology and etiology of 
multiple diseases due to their pervasive roles in cellular functions. Here, we 
will summarize recent advances in the regulatory and functional role of RNA 
modifications in these cellular functions, emphasizing the context-specific 
roles of RNA modifications in mammalian systems. As m6A is the best studied RNA 
modification in biological processes, this review will summarize the emerging 
advances on the diverse roles of m6A in cellular functions. In addition, we will 
also provide an overview for the cellular functions of other RNA modifications, 
including m5C and m1A. Furthermore, we will also discuss the roles of RNA 
modifications within the context of disease etiologies and highlight recent 
advances in the development of therapeutics that target RNA modifications. 
Elucidating these context-specific functions will increase our understanding of 
how these modifications become dysregulated during disease pathogenesis and may 
provide new opportunities for improving disease prevention and therapy by 
targeting these pathways.

A simple method that combines liquid-liquid phase separation and 
high-temperature pyrolysis has been developed for the synthesis of 
polyimide-derived porous carbon/Co particle-based composite absorbers 
(PIC/Co-800 and PIC/Co-1000). The excellent heat resistance of polyimide allows 
the composite precursor to maintain its porous structure during pyrolysis. 
According to the results, PIC/Co-800 and PIC/Co-1000 have a coral-like porous 
structure, which can enhance the impedance matching property and microwave 
attenuation ability of the synthesized materials. The impedance matching 
condition and dissipation ability of PIC/Co-800 and PIC/Co-1000 have been 
enhanced due to the synergistic effect between the carbon-induced dielectric 
loss and Co nanoparticle-induced magnetic loss. PIC/Co-1000 shows the highest 
absorption performance with a minimum reflection loss (RL) of -40.22 dB at a 
thickness of 5.3 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth (EABW, RL ≤ -10 dB) of 
4.10 GHz at a thickness of 1.4 mm. With thicknesses in the range of 1.4 mm to 
5.3 mm, the minimum RL value of each thickness is lower than -15 dB. Therefore, 
this work provides a new strategy for the synthesis of promising absorbing 
materials with outstanding EMW absorption performance.

Diet and lifestyle factors greatly affect health and susceptibility to diseases, 
including cancer. Stem cells' functions, including their ability to divide 
asymmetrically, set the rules for tissue homeostasis, contribute to health 
maintenance, and represent the entry point of cancer occurrence. Stem cell 
properties result from the complex integration of intrinsic, extrinsic, and 
systemic factors. In this context, diet-induced metabolic changes can have a 
profound impact on stem cell fate determination, lineage specification and 
differentiation. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive 
description of the multiple "non-metabolic" effects of diet on stem cell 
functions, including little-known effects such as those on liquid-liquid phase 
separation and on non-random chromosome segregation (asymmetric division). A 
deep understanding of the specific dietetic requirements of normal and cancer 
stem cells may pave the way for the development of nutrition-based targeted 
therapeutic approaches to improve regenerative and anticancer therapies.

Stress is an inevitable part of life. An organism is exposed to multiple 
stresses and overcomes their negative consequences throughout its entire 
existence. A correlation was established between life expectancy and resistance 
to stress, suggesting a relationship between aging and the ability to respond to 
external adverse effects as well as quickly restore the normal regulation of 
biological processes. To combat stress, cells developed multiple pro-survival 
mechanisms, one of them is the assembly of special stress-induced membraneless 
organelles (MLOs). MLOs are formations that do not possess a lipid membrane but 
rather form as a result of the "liquid-liquid" phase separation (LLPS) of 
biopolymers. Stress-responsive MLOs were found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, 
they form as a reaction to the acute environmental conditions and are dismantled 
after its termination. These compartments function to prevent damage to the 
genetic and protein material of the cell during stress. In this review, we 
discuss the characteristics of stress-induced MLO-like structures in eukaryotic 
and prokaryotic cells.

In this review, we discuss various methods of reproducing life dynamics using a 
constructive approach. An increase in the structural complexity of a model 
protocell is accompanied by an increase in the stage of reproduction of a 
compartment (giant vesicle; GV) from simple reproduction to linked reproduction 
with the replication of information molecules (DNA), and eventually to recursive 
proliferation of a model protocell. An encounter between a plural protic 
catalyst (C) and DNA within a GV membrane containing a plural cationic lipid (V) 
spontaneously forms a supramolecular catalyst (C@DNA) that catalyzes the 
production of cationic membrane lipid V. The local formation of V causes budding 
deformation of the GV and equivolume divisions. The length of the DNA strand 
influences the frequency of proliferation, associated with the emergence of a 
primitive information flow that induces phenotypic plasticity in response to 
environmental conditions. A predominant protocell appears from the competitive 
proliferation of protocells containing DNA with different strand lengths, 
leading to an evolvable model protocell. Recently, peptides of amino acid 
thioesters have been used to construct peptide droplets through liquid-liquid 
phase separation. These droplets grew, owing to the supply of nutrients, and 
were divided repeatedly under a physical stimulus. This proposed chemical system 
demonstrates a new perspective of the origins of membraneless protocells, i.e., 
the "droplet world" hypothesis. Proliferative model protocells can be regarded 
as autonomous supramolecular machines. This concept of this review may open new 
horizons of "evolution" for intelligent supramolecular machines and robotics.

The innate immune response constitutes the cell's first line of defense against 
viruses and culminates in the expression of type I interferon (IFN) and 
IFN-stimulated genes, inducing an antiviral state in infected and neighboring 
cells. Efficient signal transduction is a key factor for strong but controlled 
type I IFN expression and depends on the compartmentalization of different steps 
of the signaling cascade and dynamic events between the involved compartments or 
organelles. This compartmentalization of the innate immune players not only 
relies on their association with membranous organelles but also includes the 
formation of supramolecular organizing centers (SMOCs) and effector 
concentration by liquid-liquid phase separation. For their successful 
replication, viruses need to evade innate defenses and evolve a multitude of 
strategies to impair type I IFN induction, one of which is the disruption of 
spatial immune signaling dynamics. This review focuses on the role of 
compartmentalization in ensuring an adequate innate immune response to viral 
pathogens, drawing attention to crucial translocation events occurring 
downstream of pattern recognition and leading to the expression of type I IFN. 
Furthermore, it intends to highlight concise examples of viral countermeasures 
interfering with this spatial organization to alleviate the innate immune 
response.

Salt-Induced Transitions in the Conformational Ensembles of Intrinsically 
Disordered Proteins.

Salts modulate the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and 
influence the formation of membraneless organelles through liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS). In low ionic strength solutions, IDP conformations are 
perturbed by the screening of electrostatic interactions, independent of the 
salt identity. In this regime, insight into the IDP behavior can be obtained 
using the theory for salt-induced transitions in charged polymers. However, 
salt-specific interactions with the charged and uncharged residues, known as the 
Hofmeister effect, influence IDP behavior in high ionic strength solutions. 
There is a lack of reliable theoretical models in high salt concentration 
regimes to predict the salt effect on IDPs. We propose a simulation methodology 
using a coarse-grained IDP model and experimentally measured water to salt 
solution transfer free energies of various chemical groups that allowed us to 
study the salt-specific transitions induced in the IDPs conformational ensemble. 
We probed the effect of three different monovalent salts on five IDPs belonging 
to various polymer classes based on charged residue content. We demonstrate that 
all of the IDPs of different polymer classes behave as self-avoiding walks 
(SAWs) at physiological salt concentration. In high salt concentrations, the 
transitions observed in the IDP conformational ensembles are dependent on the 
salt used and the IDP sequence and composition. Changing the anion with the 
cation fixed can result in the IDP transition from a SAW-like behavior to a 
collapsed globule. An important implication of these results is that a suitable 
salt can be identified to induce condensation of an IDP through LLPS.

Stress granules (SGs) are cytosolic ribonucleoprotein granules that form via a 
liquid-liquid phase separation in response to environmental stresses such as 
heat, oxidative, and osmotic changes. Due to the condensation of low complexity, 
hydrophobic regions in core SG components in these highly dynamic granules, 
defects in SG maintenance and formation have been linked to toxic aggregate 
formation in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
and frontotemporal dementia. However, efforts to dissect mechanisms regulating 
SG formation and maintenance have been limited by methods of tracking protein-SG 
localization. Here we describe a method for detecting and quantifying 
recruitment of cytosolically enriched proteins to SGs by indirect 
immunofluorescence microscopy. Using this method, we tracked the transient 
recruitment of the cytosolically enriched ubiquitin-like protein, ubiquilin 2 
(UBQLN2), and a number of other factors into SGs, demonstrating its utility 
(Alexander et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 115:E11485-E11494, 2018).

Co-exposure to tobacco and marijuana has become common in areas where 
recreational marijuana use is legal. To assist in the determination of the 
combined health risks of this co-exposure, an analytical method capable of 
simultaneously measuring tobacco and marijuana metabolites is needed to reduce 
laboratory costs and the required sample volume. So far, no such analytical 
method exists. Thus, we developed and validated a method to simultaneously 
quantify urinary levels of trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (3OH-COT), cotinine (COT), 
and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (COOH-THC) to assess co-exposure to 
tobacco and marijuana. Urine (200 µL) was spiked with labelled internal 
standards and enzymatically hydrolyzed to liberate the conjugated analytes 
before extraction using solid-supported liquid-liquid extraction (SLE) with 
ethyl acetate serving as an eluent. The target analytes were separated on a C18 
(4.6 × 100 mm, 5 μm) analytical column with a gradient mobile phase elution and 
analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring of 
target ion transitions. Positive electrospray ionization (ESI) was used for 
3OH-COT and COT, while negative ESI was used for COOH-THC. The total run time 
was 13 min. The extraction recoveries were 18.4-23.9 % (3OH-COT), 65.1-96.8 % 
(COT), and 80.6-95.4 % (COOH-THC). The method limits of quantification were 
5.0 ng/mL (3OH-COT) and 2.5 ng/mL (COT and COOH-THC). The method showed good 
accuracy (82.5-98.5 %) and precision (1.22-6.21 % within-day precision and 
1.42-6.26 % between-day precision). The target analytes were stable for at least 
144 h inside the autosampler (10 °C). The analyses of reference materials and 
146 urine samples demonstrated good method performance. The use of a 96-well 
plate for preparation makes the method useful for the analysis of large numbers 
of samples.

ConspectusThere is a continuous demand to improve our understanding of 
fundamental processes that underlie human health and disease. Therefore, novel 
strategies that can assist in these efforts are required. For example, molecular 
biology and genetic approaches have revolutionized our understanding of 
protein-mediated processes by facilitating their direct visualization and 
analyses in living cells. Despite these developments, genetic manipulation has 
limitations in controlling events that occur after translation such as 
posttranslational modifications (PTMs), which are imperative regulatory 
elements. As a result, developing new methods to study PTMs in live cells is a 
major bottleneck in deciphering their exact roles in the myriad cellular 
processes.Synthetic and semisynthetic proteins are prepared by combining solid 
phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and chemoselective ligation approaches with 
synthetic or recombinant peptides. Employing protein synthesis allows chemists 
to incorporate natural and unnatural modifications with virtually unlimited 
number of functional groups into the protein's sequence, such as PTMs and their 
mimics. In addition, synthetic proteins can include additional elements such as 
fluorescent tags, reactive groups, caged units, and enrichment handles. 
Therefore, harnessing the power of chemical protein synthesis offers great 
opportunities to study fundamental biological processes.Unfortunately, the low 
cell permeability of proteins limits their applications mainly to in vitro 
settings, excluding live cell studies. As a result, chemical biologists have 
been attempting to overcome these limitations by developing protein delivery 
methods that would enable the study of custom-made proteins in a biological 
context. Success with these strategies should enable accurate determination of 
protein localization, degradation, folding, interactions, and involvement in the 
assembly of membrane-less organelles formed by liquid-liquid phase separation 
inside cells. Importantly, protein delivery approaches are complementary to 
genetic manipulations, and combining these approaches should pave the way to new 
discoveries.In this Account, we describe recent developments in protein delivery 
methods, with emphasis on those most compatible with synthetic proteins. We 
highlight experimental approaches and conceptual adaptations required to design 
and study synthetic proteins in live cells, with or without genetic 
manipulation. In addition, we highlight the strength and weakness of these 
approaches for both the delivery and the subsequent studies. We also describe 
our endeavors to deliver synthetic proteins to cells via cell penetrating 
peptides (CPPs) and multiplexed bead loading (MBL), as showcases of the 
applications of these methods to shed light on biological processes. Lastly, we 
contemplate other future applications of synthetic proteins to answer questions 
that are currently unapproachable.

Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) functions as a key sensor for microbial invasion 
and cellular damage by detecting emerging cytosolic DNA. Here, we report that 
GTPase-activating protein-(SH3 domain)-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) primes cGAS for 
its prompt activation by engaging cGAS in a primary liquid-phase condensation 
state. Using high-resolution microscopy, we show that in resting cells, cGAS 
exhibits particle-like morphological characteristics, which are markedly 
weakened when G3BP1 is deleted. Upon DNA challenge, the pre-condensed cGAS 
undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) more efficiently. Importantly, 
G3BP1 deficiency or its inhibition dramatically diminishes DNA-induced LLPS and 
the subsequent activation of cGAS. Interestingly, RNA, previously reported to 
form condensates with cGAS, does not activate cGAS. Accordingly, we find that 
DNA - but not RNA - treatment leads to the dissociation of G3BP1 from cGAS. 
Taken together, our study shows that the primary condensation state of cGAS is 
critical for its rapid response to DNA.

The coacervates of the Poly (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic 
acid-co-acrylonitrile) / β-Galactosidase complex are characterized using several 
techniques (Turbidimetry, dynamic and static light scattering (DLS / SLS), 
optical microscopy, image dynamic light scattering (IDLS), and ultra-small 
angles light scattering (USALS)). Turbidity and SLS were used to accurately 
determine the critical pHs of complex formation (pHc, pHϕ1, pHopt, and pHϕ2), 
DLS was used to probe the microscopic structure of coacervate droplets rich in 
proteins and polyelectrolytes in liquid-liquid phase separation, and IDLS and 
USALS have been introduced to better understand, during aging, the topology of 
the network formed of materials based on fractals in the dense phase. 
Observations of the architecture, the spatial inhomogeneity, and the size 
distributions of liquid complex coacervate droplets and fractal solid 
precipitates, were performed by optical microscopy. The pair-distance 
distribution function, P(r), presented in this review, is a new methodology of 
calculus for determining with precision the radius of gyration Rg of droplets 
coacervates. These techniques show that aging improves the stability of swollen 
condensates, the growth of the coacervate droplets is due to the attractive 
electrostatic interactions within the complex and does not undergo Ostwald 
ripening, except for the case of pHopt and having fractal dimensions Df 
generated by diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA).

Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Post-translational modifications of 
huntingtin protein (HTT), such as phosphorylation, acetylation and 
ubiquitination, have been implicated in HD pathogenesis. Arginine 
methylation/dimethylation is an important modification with an emerging role in 
neurodegeneration; however, arginine methylation of HTT remains largely 
unexplored. Here we report nearly two dozen novel arginine 
methylation/dimethylation sites on the endogenous HTT from human and mouse brain 
and human cells suggested by mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. 
Targeted quantitative mass spectrometry identified differential arginine 
methylation at specific sites in HD patient-derived striatal precursor cell 
lines compared to normal controls. We found that HTT can interact with several 
type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) via its N-terminal domain. 
Using a combination of in vitro methylation and cell-based experiments, we 
identified PRMT4 (CARM1) and PRMT6 as major enzymes methylating HTT at specific 
arginines. Alterations of these methylation sites had a profound effect on 
biochemical properties of HTT rendering it less soluble in cells and affected 
its liquid-liquid phase separation and phase transition patterns in vitro. We 
found that expanded HTT 1-586 fragment can form liquid-like assemblies, which 
converted into solid-like assemblies when the R200/205 methylation sites were 
altered. Methyl-null alterations increased HTT toxicity to neuronal cells, while 
overexpression of PRMT 4 and 6 was beneficial for neuronal survival. Thus, 
arginine methylation pathways that involve specific HTT-modifying PRMT enzymes 
and modulate HTT biochemical and toxic properties could provide targets for 
HD-modifying therapies.

Zalpha (Zα) domains bind to left-handed Z-DNA and Z-RNA. The Zα domain protein 
family includes cellular (ADAR1, ZBP1 and PKZ) and viral (vaccinia virus E3 and 
cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) ORF112) proteins. We studied CyHV-3 ORF112, 
which contains an intrinsically disordered region and a Zα domain. Genome 
editing of CyHV-3 indicated that the expression of only the Zα domain of ORF112 
was sufficient for normal viral replication in cell culture and virulence in 
carp. In contrast, its deletion was lethal for the virus. These observations 
revealed the potential of the CyHV-3 model as a unique platform to compare the 
exchangeability of Zα domains expressed alone in living cells. Attempts to 
rescue the ORF112 deletion by a broad spectrum of cellular, viral, and 
artificial Zα domains showed that only those expressing Z-binding activity, the 
capacity to induce liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and A-to-Z conversion, 
could rescue viral replication. For the first time, this study reports the 
ability of some Zα domains to induce LLPS and supports the biological relevance 
of dsRNA A-to-Z conversion mediated by Zα domains. This study expands the 
functional diversity of Zα domains and stimulates new hypotheses concerning the 
mechanisms of action of proteins containing Zα domains.

γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the human 
central nervous system, is often abused in drug-facilitated sexual assaults due 
to its euphoric and sedative effects. While the analysis of GHB has received 
continuous attention, its inherent characteristics pose challenges. In the 
current study, capillary electrophoresis (CE) with capacitively coupled 
contactless conductivity detection (C4D) was built, and Good's buffers were 
evaluated as the background electrolytes for CE separation and C4D detection. On 
this basis, a simple and efficient CE-C4D method was developed for GHB analysis. 
Through theoretical discussion and experimental optimization, the separation of 
GHB and related positional isomers α-hydroxybutyric acid (AHB) and 
β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) was achieved within 4 min using 150 mM 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) as the running 
buffer. Under the optimized condition, the relative standard deviations of 
migration time and peak area were less than 1.1% and 4.5%, indicating good 
precision. The C4D signal of GHB showed a good linear relationship with GHB 
concentration in the range of 3-300 µM with a determination coefficient of 
0.9997, and the detection limit was calculated to be 0.37 µM based on the 
signal-to-noise ratio of three. Furthermore, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and 
solid-phase extraction (SPE) were comparatively studied for sample matrix 
purification. Combined with the optimized SPE procedure, the developed CE-C4D 
method has been successfully applied for the determination of exogenous GHB in 
spiked beverages and endogenous GHB in human urine.

The reversible modification of proteins with lipoic acid (LPA)-derived 
polydisulfides (PDS) is an important approach toward the transient regulation 
and on-demand recovery of protein functions. The in situ growth of PDS from the 
cysteine (Cys) residue of a protein, however, has been challenging due to the 
near-equilibrium thermodynamics of the ring-opening polymerization of LPA. Here, 
we report the protein-mediated, aggregation-induced polymerization (AIP) of 
amphiphilic LPA-derived monomers at room temperature, which can be performed at 
a concentration as low as ∼2% of the equilibrium monomer concentration normally 
needed. The aggregation of monomers increases the effective monomer 
concentration in aqueous solutions to the degree that the polymerizations behave 
similarly to those in bulk. The PDS conjugation enhances the thermostability, 
protease resistance, and tolerance to freeze-thaw treatments of the target 
proteins. Moreover, the PDS conjugation allows rapid and convenient purification 
of Cys-bearing proteins by taking advantage of the liquid-liquid phase 
separation of the protein-PDS conjugates and the full recovery of native 
proteins under mild reducing conditions. This AIP effect may shed light on 
facilitating other polymerizations with a similar near-equilibrium character. 
The PDS conjugation can open up new avenues to protein delivery, dynamic and 
reversible protein engineering, enzyme preservation, and recycling.

When materials freeze, they often undergo damage due to ice growth. Although 
this damage is commonly ascribed to the volumetric expansion of water upon 
freezing, it is usually driven by the flow of water toward growing ice crystals 
that feeds their growth. The freezing of this additional water can cause a large 
buildup of stress. Here, we demonstrate a technique for characterizing this 
stress buildup with unprecedented spatial resolution. We create a stable 
ice-water interface in a controlled temperature gradient and measure the 
deformation of the confining boundary. Analysis of the deformation field reveals 
stresses applied to the boundary with [Formula: see text](micrometers) spatial 
resolution. Globally, stresses increase steadily over time as liquid water is 
transported to more deeply undercooled regions. Locally, stresses increase until 
ice growth is stalled by the confining stresses. Importantly, we find a strong 
localization of stresses, which significantly increases the likelihood of damage 
caused by the presence of ice, even in apparently benign freezing situations. 
Ultimately, the limiting stress that the ice exerts is proportional to the local 
undercooling, in accordance with the Clapeyron equation, which describes the 
equilibrium between a stressed solid and its melt. Our results are closely 
connected to the condensation pressure during liquid-liquid phase separation and 
the crystallization pressure for growing crystals. Thus, they are highly 
relevant in fields ranging from cryopreservation and frost heave to food 
science, rock weathering, and art conservation.

In this study, we aimed to explore the morphologies of porous poly(lactic acid) 
(PLA) fibers through liquid-liquid phase separation, and investigate the 
relationship among pore formation, physical properties, and antibacterial 
activities of the fibers for identifying their potential as drug delivery 
carriers. Antibacterial activities of gentamicin-, kanamycin-, and 
amikacin-loaded PLA fibers against E. coli and S. epidermidis were evaluated. 
The antibacterial activity of drugs against E. coli showed the following 
profile: gentamicin &gt; amikacin &gt; kanamycin; however, S. epidermidis growth 
was almost completely inhibited immediately after the administration of all 
three drugs. The efficiency of gentamicin can be attributed to the electrostatic 
interactions between the positively and negatively charged antibiotic and 
bacterial cell membrane, respectively. Furthermore, gentamicin-loaded porous PLA 
fibers were evaluated as drug delivery systems. The cumulative amount of 
gentamicin in porous PLA nanofibers was considerably higher than that in other 
PLA fibers for 168 h, followed by 7:3 PLA &gt; 6:4 PLA &gt; 5:5 PLA &gt; 
non-porous PLA. The 7:3 PLA fibers were projected to be ideal drug carrier 
candidates for controlled antibiotic release in delivery systems owing to their 
interconnected internal structure and the largest surface area (55.61 m2 g-1), 
pore size (42.19 nm), and pore volume (12.78 cm3 g-1).

Biomolecular condensates formed by the process of liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) play diverse roles inside cells, from spatiotemporal compartmentalisation 
to speeding up chemical reactions. Upon maturation, the liquid-like properties 
of condensates, which underpin their functions, are gradually lost, eventually 
giving rise to solid-like states with potential pathological implications. 
Enhancement of inter-protein interactions is one of the main mechanisms 
suggested to trigger the formation of solid-like condensates. To gain a 
molecular-level understanding of how the accumulation of stronger interactions 
among proteins inside condensates affect the kinetic and thermodynamic 
properties of biomolecular condensates, and their shapes over time, we develop a 
tailored coarse-grained model of proteins that transition from establishing weak 
to stronger inter-protein interactions inside condensates. Our simulations 
reveal that the fast accumulation of strongly binding proteins during the 
nucleation and growth stages of condensate formation results in aspherical 
solid-like condensates. In contrast, when strong inter-protein interactions 
appear only after the equilibrium condensate has been formed, or when they 
accumulate slowly over time with respect to the time needed for droplets to fuse 
and grow, spherical solid-like droplets emerge. By conducting atomistic 
potential-of-mean-force simulations of NUP-98 peptides-prone to forming 
inter-protein [Formula: see text]-sheets-we observe that formation of 
inter-peptide [Formula: see text]-sheets increases the strength of the 
interactions consistently with the loss of liquid-like condensate properties we 
observe at the coarse-grained level. Overall, our work aids in elucidating 
fundamental molecular, kinetic, and thermodynamic mechanisms linking the rate of 
change in protein interaction strength to condensate shape and maturation during 
ageing.

For disordered proteins, including α-synuclein (Syn), the aggregation of which 
is implicated in Parkinson's disease, it is known that at mild acidic and at the 
pI solution conditions the use of either strong or weak electrolytes minimized 
Syn aggregation. The mechanism is driven by electrostatic forces but remains, 
however, poorly understood. To address this issue, we used two biological 
buffers as weak electrolytes, at a low concentration (10 mM) and monitored the 
aggregation of Syn solutions from pH 7 to pH 2, by means of light scattering 
techniques. When the citrate buffer was used, in which there is buffering 
capacity in the pH range studied, the maximum of Syn aggregation was very close 
to the isoelectric point (pI = 4.7). When using tris-HCl, in which there is 
almost no buffering capacity in the pH range studied, it was for the first time 
observed a slow transition of the pI (of ca. 1 h) from 4.7 to 4-3, for a 33.5 μM 
protein concentration, as an example. We also observed in the protein solutions 
(in tris-HCl) the very early formation of large Syn aggregates. When there is 
buffering capacity, such as pH 7, these early large Syn aggregates dissociate, 
followed by association/aggregation. When there is no buffering capacity, such 
as pH 3, the referred early large Syn aggregates only dissociate. Overall, early 
large Syn aggregates dissociation can cause entropy in the protein solutions and 
Syn aggregation is only restored by the altered electrostatic forces due to the 
existing buffering capacity. Finally, by using an innovative strategy based in 
the ANS dye fluorescence intensity variation, we determined of the occurrence of 
the liquid-liquid phase separation process at pH 7 Syn solutions.

The slime of velvet worms (Onychophora) is a strong and fully biodegradable 
protein material, which upon ejection undergoes a fast liquid-to-solid 
transition to ensnare prey. However, the molecular mechanisms of slime 
self-assembly are still not well understood, notably because the primary 
structures of slime proteins are yet unknown. Combining transcriptomic and 
proteomic studies, the authors have obtained the complete primary sequences of 
slime proteins and identified key features for slime self-assembly. The high 
molecular weight slime proteins contain cysteine residues at the N- and 
C-termini that mediate the formation of multi-protein complexes via disulfide 
bonding. Low complexity domains in the N-termini are also identified and their 
propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation is established, which may play a 
central role in slime biofabrication. Using solid-state nuclear magnetic 
resonance, rigid and flexible domains of the slime proteins are mapped to 
specific peptide domains. The complete sequencing of major slime proteins is an 
important step toward sustainable fabrication of polymers inspired by the velvet 
worm slime.

Liquid droplets of a host protein, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation, 
recruit guest proteins and provide functional fields. Recruitment into p53 
droplets is similar between disordered and folded guest proteins, whereas the 
diffusion of guest proteins inside droplets depends on their structural types. 
In this study, to elucidate how the recruitment and diffusion properties of 
guest proteins are affected by a host protein, we characterized the properties 
of guest proteins in fused in sarcoma (FUS) droplets using single-molecule 
fluorescence microscopy in comparison with p53 droplets. Unlike p53 droplets, 
disordered guest proteins were recruited into FUS droplets more efficiently than 
folded guest proteins, suggesting physical exclusion of the folded proteins from 
the small voids of the droplet. The recruitment did not appear to depend on the 
physical parameters (electrostatic or cation-π) of guests, implying that 
molecular size exclusion limits intermolecular interaction-assisted uptake. The 
diffusion of disordered guest proteins was comparable to that of the host FUS, 
whereas that of folded proteins varied widely, similar to the results for host 
p53. The scaling exponent of diffusion highlights the molecular sieving of large 
folded proteins in droplets. Finally, we proposed a molecular recruitment and 
diffusion model for guest proteins in FUS droplets.

Our understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia 
has advanced dramatically since the discovery of cytoplasmic TAR DNA-binding 
protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions as the hallmark pathology of these 
neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have provided insights into the 
physiological function of TDP-43 as an essential DNA-/RNA-modulating protein, 
and the triggers and consequences of TDP-43 dysfunction and aggregation. The 
formation of TDP-43 pathology is a progressive process, involving the generation 
of multiple distinct protein species, each with varying biophysical properties 
and roles in neurodegeneration. Here, we explore how the pathogenic changes to 
TDP-43, including mislocalisation, misfolding, aberrant liquid-liquid phase 
separation, stress granule assembly, oligomerisation, and post-translational 
modification, drive disease-associated aggregation in TDP-43 proteinopathies. We 
highlight how pathological TDP-43 species are formed and contribute to cellular 
dysfunction and toxicity, via both loss-of-function and gain-of-function 
mechanisms. We also review the role of protein homeostasis mechanisms, namely 
the ubiquitin proteasome system, autophagy-lysosome pathway, heat-shock 
response, and chaperone-mediated autophagy, in combating TDP-43 aggregation and 
discuss how their dysfunction likely promotes disease pathogenesis and 
progression. Finally, we evaluate pre-clinical studies aimed at enhancing TDP-43 
protein clearance via these mechanisms and provide insight on promising 
strategies for future therapeutic advances. Harnessing the mechanisms that 
protect against or ameliorate TDP-43 pathology presents promising opportunities 
for developing disease-modifying treatments for these neurodegenerative 
diseases.

Death domain fold (DDF) superfamily comprises of the death domain (DD), death 
effector domain (DED), caspase activation recruitment domain (CARD), and pyrin 
domain (PYD). By utilizing a conserved mode of interaction involving six 
distinct surfaces, a DDF serves as a building block that can densely pack into 
homomultimers or filaments. Studies of immune signaling components have revealed 
that DDF-mediated filament formation plays a central role in mediating signal 
transduction and amplification. The unique ability of DDFs to self-oligomerize 
upon external signals and induce oligomerization of partner molecules underlies 
key processes in many innate immune signaling pathways, as exemplified by 
RIG-I-like receptor signalosome and inflammasome assembly. Recent studies showed 
that DDFs are not only limited to immune signaling pathways, but also are 
involved with transcriptional regulation and other biological processes. 
Considering that DDF annotation still remains a challenge, the current list of 
DDFs and their functions may represent just the tip of the iceberg within the 
full spectrum of DDF biology. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our 
understanding of DDF functions, structures, and assembly architectures with a 
focus on CARD- and PYD-containing proteins. We also discuss areas of future 
research and the potential relationship of DDFs with biomolecular condensates 
formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).

TDP-43 proteinopathies cover a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS). Hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 was found within the inclusion bodies in 
disease lesions; however, the role of hyperphosphorylation and the toxic species 
are still ambiguous. To characterize the hyperphosphorylation effect of TDP-43, 
here, we employed five serine mutations implicated in the diseases at serine 
locations 379, 403, 404, 409, and 410 in the C-terminus to aspartate (S5D) and 
to alanine (S5A). We systematically characterized the conformation, 
liquid-liquid phase separation, oligomerization, and fibrillization of TDP-43 
variants. Results revealed that the recombinant TDP-43 variants readily formed 
structurally similar spherical oligomers, as evidenced by circular dichroism 
spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, the TDP-43 oligomer-specific antibody 
assay, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. After 
incubation, only the phosphor-mimic S5D TDP-43 formed thioflavin-positive 
amyloid fibrils, whereas wild-type and S5A TDP-43 formed amorphous aggregates. 
We also examined membrane disruption, the cytotoxicity of human neuroblastoma, 
and the synaptic loss of primary neurons induced by oligomers and large 
aggregates of TDP-43. The results showed that all oligomeric TDP-43 variants 
were toxic regardless of hyperphosphorylation, but the fibrils and amorphous 
aggregates were not. Overall, our results demonstrated the hyperphosphorylation 
effect on fibril formation and the toxicity attributed from TDP-43 oligomers. 
This study facilitates the understanding and therapeutic development for TDP-43 
proteinopathies.

Understanding and ameliorating neurodegenerative diseases represents a key 
challenge for supporting the health span of the aging population. Diverse 
protein aggregates have been implicated in such neurodegenerative disorders, 
including amyloid-β, α-synuclein, tau, fused in sarcoma (FUS), and 
transactivation response element (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Recent 
years have seen significant growth in our mechanistic knowledge of relationships 
between these proteins and some of the membrane-less nuclear structures that 
fulfill key roles in the cell function. These include the nucleolus, nuclear 
speckles, and paraspeckles. The ability of macromolecular protein:RNA complexes 
to partition these nuclear condensates through biophysical processes that 
involve liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has also gained attention 
recently. The paraspeckle, which is scaffolded by the architectural 
long-non-coding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) plays central 
roles in RNA processing and metabolism and has been linked dynamically to 
TDP-43. In this mini-review, we outline essential early and recent insights in 
relation to TDP-43 proteinopathies. We then appraise the relationships between 
TDP-43 and NEAT1 in the context of neuronal paraspeckles and neuronal stress. We 
highlight key areas for investigation based on recent advances in our 
understanding of how TDP-43 affects neuronal function, especially in relation to 
messenger ribosomal nucleic acid (mRNA) splicing. Finally, we offer perspectives 
that should be considered for translational pipelines in order to improve health 
outcomes for the management of neurodegenerative diseases.

What do we know about Ki-67, apart from its usefulness as a cell proliferation 
biomarker in histopathology? Discovered in 1983, the protein and its regulation 
of expression and localisation throughout the cell cycle have been well 
characterised. However, its function and molecular mechanisms have received 
little attention and few answers. Although Ki-67 has long been thought to be 
required for cell proliferation, recent genetic studies have conclusively 
demonstrated that this is not the case, as loss of Ki-67 has little or no impact 
on cell proliferation. In contrast, Ki-67 is important for localising nucleolar 
material to the mitotic chromosome periphery and for structuring perinucleolar 
heterochromatin, and emerging data indicate that it also has critical roles in 
cancer development. However, its mechanisms of action have not yet been fully 
identified. Here, we review recent findings and propose the hypothesis that 
Ki-67 is involved in structuring cellular sub-compartments that assemble by 
liquid-liquid phase separation. At the heterochromatin boundary, this may 
control access of chromatin regulators, with knock-on effects on gene expression 
programmes. These changes allow adaptation of the cell to its environment, 
which, for cancer cells, is a hostile one. We discuss unresolved questions and 
possible avenues for future exploration.

Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is the primary biological process by 
which protein abundance is regulated and protein homeostasis is maintained in 
eukaryotic cells. Speckle-type pox virus and zinc finger (POZ) protein (SPOP) is 
a typical substrate adaptor of the Cullin 3-RING ligase (CRL3) family; it serves 
as a bridge between the Cullin 3 (Cul3) scaffold protein and its substrates. In 
recent years, SPOP has received increasing attention because of its versatility 
in its regulatory pathways and the diversity of tumor types involved. 
Mechanistically, SPOP substrates are involved in a wide range of biological 
processes, and abnormalities in SPOP function perturb downstream biological 
processes and promote tumorigenesis. Additionally, liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS), a potential mechanism of membraneless organelle formation, 
was recently found to mediate the self-triggered colocalization of substrates 
with higher-order oligomers of SPOP. Herein, we summarize the structure of SPOP 
and the specific mechanisms by which it mediates the efficient ubiquitination of 
substrates. Additionally, we review the biological functions of SPOP, the 
regulation of SPOP expression, the role of SPOP in tumorigenesis and its 
therapeutic value.

Group 1 (Dur-19, PF00477, LEA_5) Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins are 
present in organisms from all three domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria, and 
Eukarya. Surprisingly, Artemia is the only genus known to include animals that 
express group 1 LEA proteins in their desiccation-tolerant life-history stages. 
Bioinformatics analysis of circular dichroism data indicates that the group 1 
LEA protein AfLEA1 is surprisingly ordered in the hydrated state and undergoes 
during desiccation one of the most pronounced disorder-to-order transitions 
described for LEA proteins from A. franciscana. The secondary structure in the 
hydrated state is dominated by random coils (42%) and β-sheets (35%) but 
converts to predominately α-helices (85%) when desiccated. Interestingly, AfLEA1 
interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids, and RNA promotes liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS) of the protein from the solvent during dehydration in 
vitro. Furthermore, AfLEA1 protects the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
during desiccation but does not aid in restoring LDH activity after 
desiccation-induced inactivation. Ectopically expressed in D. melanogaster Kc167 
cells, AfLEA1 localizes predominantly to the cytosol and increases the cytosolic 
viscosity during desiccation compared to untransfected control cells. 
Furthermore, the protein formed small biomolecular condensates in the cytoplasm 
of about 38% of Kc167 cells. These findings provide additional evidence for the 
hypothesis that the formation of biomolecular condensates to promote water 
stress tolerance during anhydrobiosis may be a shared feature across several 
groups of LEA proteins that display LLPS behaviors.

The wide variety of sex hormone actions underlie bone growth and health, and 
their actions mediate gene regulation by the cognate nuclear receptors. Nuclear 
androgen and estrogen receptors (AR, and ERα/ERβ) are hormone-dependent and DNA 
binding- transcription regulatory factors, and gene regulation by sex hormones 
often accompany with chromatin remodeling under aid of a number of 
co-regulators. As sex hormone biosynthesis is under highly regulated systemic 
and local regulations, the skeletal actions of sex hormones could be inferred 
from only the phenotypic abnormalities in skeleton in mouse genetic models 
deficient of nuclear receptors selectively in specific types of bone cells as 
well as at specific cell differentiation stages. Anabolic androgen actions and 
anti-bone resorptive estrogen actions are discussed here from the phenotypic 
abnormalities in such model mice. Though rapid gene regulation by sex hormones 
may not require chromatin reorganization, dynamic chromatin reconfiguration 
looks to facilitate profound and long-term hormonal actions. In this review, we 
focus the recent findings in gene regulation at a chromatin level, particularly 
of the function of enhancer RNAs transcribed from strong enhancers, and in the 
role of liquid-liquid phase separation state in transcription initiation through 
chromatin reconfiguration.

Soluble oligomers populating early amyloid aggregation can be regarded as 
nanodroplets of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Amyloid peptides 
typically contain hydrophobic aggregation-prone regions connected by hydrophilic 
linkers and flanking sequences, and such a sequence hydropathy pattern drives 
the formation of supramolecular structures in the nanodroplets and modulates 
subsequent fibrillization. Here, we studied LLPS and fibrillization of 
coarse-grained amyloid peptides with increasing flanking sequences. Nanodroplets 
assumed lamellar, cylindrical micellar, and spherical micellar structures with 
increasing peptide hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios, and such morphologies 
governed subsequent fibrillization processes. Adding glycine-serine repeats as 
flanking sequences to Aβ<sub>16-22</sub>, the amyloidogenic core of amyloid-β, 
our computational predictions of morphological transitions were corroborated 
experimentally. The uncovered inter-relationships between the peptide sequence 
pattern, oligomer/nanodroplet morphology, and fibrillization pathway, kinetics, 
and structure may contribute to our understanding of pathogenic amyloidosis in 
aging, facilitate future efforts ameliorating amyloidosis through peptide 
engineering, and aid in the design of novel amyloid-based functional 
nanobiomaterials and nanocomposites.

RNA regulation in mammalian cells requires complex physical 
compartmentalisation, using structures thought to be formed by liquid-liquid 
phase separation. Disruption of these structures is implicated in numerous 
degenerative diseases. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multi-systemic 
trinucleotide repeat disorder resulting from an expansion of nucleotides CTG 
(CTGexp) in the DNA encoding DM1 protein kinase (DMPK). The cellular hallmark of 
DM1 is the formation of nuclear foci that contain expanded DMPK RNA (CUGexp) 
(with thymine instead of uracil). We report here the deregulation of stress 
granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P-bodies), two cytoplasmic structures key 
for mRNA regulation, in cell culture models of DM1. Alterations to the rates of 
formation and dispersal of SGs suggest an altered ability of cells to respond to 
stress associated with DM1, while changes to the structure and dynamics of SGs 
and P-bodies suggest that a widespread alteration to the biophysical properties 
of cellular structures is a consequence of the presence of CUGexp RNA.

DNA damage shuts down genome-wide transcription to prevent transcriptional 
mutagenesis and to initiate repair signalling, but the mechanism to stall 
elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is not fully understood. Central to the 
DNA damage response, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) initiates DNA repair 
by translocating to the lesions where it catalyses protein 
poly(ADP-ribosylation). Here we report that PARP1 inhibits Pol II elongation by 
inactivating the transcription elongation factor P-TEFb, a CDK9-cyclin T1 
(CycT1) heterodimer. After sensing damage, the activated PARP1 binds to 
transcriptionally engaged P-TEFb and modifies CycT1 at multiple positions, 
including histidine residues that are rarely used as an acceptor site. This 
prevents CycT1 from undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation that is required 
for CDK9 to hyperphosphorylate Pol II and to stimulate elongation. Functionally, 
poly(ADP-ribosylation) of CycT1 promotes DNA repair and cell survival. Thus, the 
P-TEFb-PARP1 signalling plays a protective role in transcription quality control 
and genomic stability maintenance after DNA damage.

Alternaria toxins are naturally occurring contaminants found in natural 
products. Given the prevalence of Alternaria toxins and the complexity of 
oil-rich matrices, achieving ultra-trace analysis has become a daunting task. A 
new sample pretreatment technique, i.e., cold-induced liquid-liquid 
microextraction combined with serially-coupled-columns for SIDA-UHPLC-MS/MS, was 
developed and reported for the first time. Theoretical and experimental 
investigations on the mechanism and key parameters revealed that the proposed 
method achieved simultaneous purification and enrichment in one-step sample 
extraction with a superior limit of quantitation (0.15-1.5 μg kg-1), without 
further sample manipulation, such as fat removal or solvent exchange procedures 
prior to LC-MS. The method was validated taking into consideration EU guidelines 
and showed acceptable linearity (r ≥ 0.9991), accuracy with recoveries between 
75 and 114% and precision with RSD≤9.7% for all of the analytes studied. It was 
successfully applied to the analysis of twenty samples sourced from the 
Mediterranean region in order to gain first insights into Alternaria toxins 
contaminations in olive oils. This technical approach is well suited for 
large-scale studies in a high-throughput and cost-effective quality assurance 
laboratory environments, and it has the potential to detect ultra-trace levels 
of toxins in complex samples, which may lead to the development of new and 
sustainable sample preparation procedures.

A new dispersive inclusion complex microextraction (DICM) approach coupled with 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) 
for the determination of n-nitrosamine impurities in different medicinal 
products is demonstrated for the first time. The proposed DICM procedures 
consist of a dispersive liquid phase microextraction steps employing 
cyclodextrin as an inclusion complex agent to extract n-nitrosamines namely 
N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), 
N-nitrosodiisopropylamine (NDIPA), N-ethyl-N-nitrosoisopropylamine (NEIPA) and 
N-nitroso-di-n-butylamine (NDBA) present in the medicinal products. The sample 
solutions were prepared by mixing 5% (m/v) NaCl solution with 1.5 mM 
β-cyclodextrin and 20 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate to form a stable inclusion 
complex and subsequently extracted into dichloromethane as an extraction 
solvent. The enriched solution was reconstituted into aqueous solution prior to 
UPLC-MS/MS analysis. The method showed good linearity in the range of 
0.036-1 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.995, acceptable 
reproducibility (RSD 0.5-5.8%, n=5), low limits of detection 
(0.011-0.018 ng/mL), and satisfactory relative recoveries (96-105%). The results 
obtained were found to be at least 10-fold more sensitive comparable to those 
obtained using validated direct sample dissolutions coupled with UPLC-MS/MS 
approach.

Human 53BP1 is primarily known as a key player in regulating DNA double strand 
break (DSB) repair choice; however, its involvement in other biological process 
is less well understood. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized function 
of 53BP1 at heterochromatin, where it undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) with the heterochromatin protein HP1α in a mutually dependent manner. 
Deletion of 53BP1 results in a reduction in heterochromatin centers and the 
de-repression of heterochromatic tandem repetitive DNA. We identify domains and 
residues of 53BP1 required for its LLPS, which overlap with, but are distinct 
from, those involved in DSB repair. Further, 53BP1 mutants deficient in DSB 
repair, but proficient in LLPS, rescue heterochromatin de-repression and protect 
cells from stress-induced DNA damage and senescence. Our study suggests that in 
addition to DSB repair modulation, 53BP1 contributes to the maintenance of 
heterochromatin integrity and genome stability through LLPS.

CNBP restricts SARS-CoV2 by regulating IFN and disrupting RNA-protein 
condensates.

Fitzgerald K, Chen Y, Lei X, Jiang Z, Humphries F, Mustone N, Ramos I, Mutetwa 
T, Fernandez-Sesma A.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evades antiviral 
immunity through the expression of viral proteins that block detection, 
signaling, interferon (IFN) induction, and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. 
Weak induction of type I IFNs is associated with a hyperinflammatory response in 
patients that develop severe COVID-19. Here we uncover a role for cellular 
nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) in restricting SARS-CoV-2. Typically, CNBP 
resides in the cytosol and, in response to RNA sensing pathways, undergoes 
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and IFNβ enhancer DNA binding to turn on 
IFNβ gene transcription. In SARS-CoV-2-infected cells CNBP coordinates IFNβ gene 
transcription. In addition, CNBP binds SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA directly. CNBP 
competes with the nucleocapsid (N) protein and prevents viral RNA and 
nucleocapsid protein from undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
forming condensates critical for viral replication. Consequently, cells and 
animals lacking CNBP have higher viral loads and CNBP-deficient mice succumb 
rapidly to infection. Altogether, these findings identify CNBP as a key 
antiviral factor for SARS-CoV-2, functioning both as a regulator of antiviral 
IFN gene expression and a cell intrinsic restriction factor that disrupts LLPS 
to limit viral replication and spread.

A simple, specific, selective and accurate bioanalytical method was developed 
and validated for simultaneous estimation of acalabrutinib and its active 
metabolite in human plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS). Deuterated analogs of both the analytes were used as internal 
standards. The extraction of analytes and internal standards were evaluated from 
the human plasma by liquid-liquid extraction technique using methyl tertiary 
butyl ether (TBME). The separation of the analytes was carried out on Zorbax 
Eclipse XDB-C18 (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column with a mixture of acetonitrile and 
10 mM ammonium formate in 0.1% formic acid buffer (65 : 35, v/v) as mobile phase 
at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1. The method linearity was determined in the widen 
concentration range from 5.000 ng mL-1 to 1600 ng mL-1 with r 2 > 0.99. The 
entire method validation was carried out as per the USFDA guidelines on 
bioanalytical method validation and all validation experiment results were found 
within acceptable limits. Clinical pharmacokinetic study of both the parent drug 
and its active metabolite was successfully performed on six healthy volunteers 
under fasting conditions by applying the present method.

Nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic mislocalization of the essential RNA binding 
protein, TDP-43, is a pathologic hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
frontotemporal dementia, and related neurodegenerative disorders collectively 
termed "TDP-43 proteinopathies." TDP-43 mislocalization causes neurodegeneration 
through both loss and gain of function mechanisms. Loss of TDP-43 nuclear RNA 
processing function destabilizes the transcriptome by multiple mechanisms 
including disruption of pre-mRNA splicing, the failure of repression of cryptic 
exons, and retrotransposon activation. The accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43, 
which is prone to aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation and aggregation, traps 
TDP-43 in the cytoplasm and disrupts a host of downstream processes including 
the trafficking of RNA granules, local translation within axons, and 
mitochondrial function. In this review, we will discuss the TDP-43 therapy 
development pipeline, beginning with therapies in current and upcoming clinical 
trials, which are primarily focused on accelerating the clearance of TDP-43 
aggregates. Then, we will look ahead to emerging strategies from preclinical 
studies, first from high-throughput genetic and pharmacologic screens, and 
finally from mechanistic studies focused on the upstream cause(s) of TDP-43 
disruption in ALS/FTD. These include modulation of stress granule dynamics, 
TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, RNA metabolism, and correction of aberrant 
splicing events.

Liquid coacervate microdroplets have been widely explored as membrane-free 
compartment protocells for cargo delivery in therapeutic applications. In this 
study, coacervate protocells were developed as gene carriers for transfection of 
nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) for killing 
of cancer cells. The coacervate microdroplet protocells were formed via the 
liquid-liquid phase separation of oppositely charged 
diethylaminoethyl-dextran/polyacrylic acids. The coacervate microdroplet 
protocells were found to facilitate gene transfection, which was demonstrated by 
cell imaging of the internalized coacervate microdroplets containing plasmids of 
enhanced green fluorescent protein. Due to their high transfection capability, 
the coacervate protocells were subsequently utilized for the delivery of NOS 
plasmids (pNOS). The cellular internalization of pNOS-containing coacervate 
carriers was found to result in high NOS expression coupled with NO 
overproduction, which then induced cell apoptosis and decreased cell viability. 
The cell apoptosis is associated with NO-mediated mitochondrial damage. The 
enhanced gene transfection was attributed to coacervate microdroplets' unique 
high sequestration capability and liquid-like fluidity. Overall, the 
incorporation of genes in coacervate microdroplets was demonstrated as a viable 
and novel strategy for the development of cargo biocarriers for biomedical 
applications.

Although nereistoxin insecticides (NIs) are banned for animal husbandry 
operations, they are still used because of their high insecticidal activities. 
Therefore, a reliable residue analysis method for the simultaneous detection of 
cartap, bensultap, thiocyclam, and nereistoxin in foods of animal origins, 
including beef, pork, chicken, milk, and eggs, was developed using hydrophilic 
interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-LC-MS/MS). The NIs 
were extracted with an acidic cysteine and formate buffer solution and 
hydrolyzed to nereistoxin. The molarity and pH of the buffer were optimized at 
20 mM and 3, respectively, to keep the pH of the extracts at 4-5. pH-dependent 
acid-base partitioning coupled with salting-out-assisted liquid-liquid 
extraction using acetonitrile was performed for purification and for the direct 
introduction of the extracts to LC. The optimal pH values were 5 and 9 for the 
acid-base partitioning. Nereistoxin quantitation was achieved with consistent 
column retention (RSD < 0.6%) and a high degree of separation (N > 106). The 
matrix-dependent method limit of quantitation was 2 μg nereistoxin/kg, and the 
calibration curve showed good linearity (R2 > 0.998). The recovery efficiencies 
were in the range of 89.2-109.9% with relative standard deviations less than 
10%, and matrix effects did not exceed ± 10%, which satisfied the criteria 
outlined in the European SANTE/12682/2019 guidelines.

Our aim was to understand mechanisms for clustering and cross-linking of 
gliadins, a wheat seed storage protein type, monomeric in native state, but 
incorporated in network while processed. The mechanisms were studied utilizing 
spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography on a gliadin-rich 
fraction, in vitro produced α-gliadins, and synthetic gliadin peptides, and by 
coarse-grained modelling, Monte Carlo simulations and prediction algorithms. In 
solution, gliadins with α-helix structures (dip at 205 nm in CD) were primarily 
present as monomeric molecules and clusters of gliadins (peaks at 650- and 700-s 
on SE-HPLC). At drying, large polymers (Rg 90.3 nm by DLS) were formed and 
β-sheets increased (14% by FTIR). Trained algorithms predicted aggregation areas 
at amino acids 115-140, 150-179, and 250-268, and induction of liquid-liquid 
phase separation at P- and Poly-Q-sequences (Score = 1). Simulations showed that 
gliadins formed polymers by tail-to-tail or a hydrophobic core (Kratky plots and 
Ree = 35 and 60 for C- and N-terminal). Thus, the N-terminal formed clusters 
while the C-terminal formed aggregates by disulphide and lanthionine bonds, with 
favoured hydrophobic clustering of similar/exact peptide sections (synthetic 
peptide mixtures on SE-HPLC). Mechanisms of clustering and cross-linking of the 
gliadins presented here, contribute ability to tailor processing results, using 
these proteins.

Cells have developed diverse mechanisms to monitor changes in their 
surroundings. This allows them to establish effective responses to cope with 
adverse environments. Some of these mechanisms have been well characterized in 
the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an excellent experimental model to 
explore and elucidate some of the strategies selected in eukaryotic organisms to 
adjust their growth and development in stressful conditions. The relevance of 
structural disorder in proteins and the impact on their functions has been 
uncovered for proteins participating in different processes. This is the case of 
some transcription factors (TFs) and other signaling hub proteins, where 
intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play a critical role in their function. 
In this work, we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to evaluate the 
significance of structural disorder in those TFs (170) recognized in S. 
cerevisiae. Our findings show that 85.2% of these TFs contain at least one IDR, 
whereas ~30% exhibit a higher disorder level and thus were considered as 
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We also found that TFs contain a 
higher number of IDRs compared to the rest of the yeast proteins, and that 
intrinsically disordered TFs (IDTFs) have a higher number of protein-protein 
interactions than those with low structural disorder. The analysis of different 
stress response pathways showed a high content of structural disorder not only 
in TFs but also in other signaling proteins. The propensity of yeast proteome to 
undergo a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) was also analyzed, showing that 
a significant proportion of IDTFs may undergo this phenomenon. Our analysis is a 
starting point for future research on the importance of structural disorder in 
yeast stress responses.

Biomolecular condensation driven by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is key 
to assembly of membraneless organelles in numerous crucial pathways. It is 
largely unknown how cellular structures or components spatiotemporally regulate 
LLPS and condensate formation. Here we reveal that cytoskeletal dynamics can 
control the condensation of p62 bodies comprising the autophagic adaptor 
p62/SQSTM1 and poly-ubiquitinated cargos. Branched actin networks are associated 
with p62 bodies and are required for their condensation. Myosin 1D, a branched 
actin-associated motor protein, drives coalescence of small nanoscale p62 bodies 
into large micron-scale condensates along the branched actin network. Impairment 
of actin cytoskeletal networks compromises the condensation of p62 bodies and 
retards substrate degradation by autophagy in both cellular models and Myosin 1D 
knockout mice. Coupling of LLPS scaffold to cytoskeleton systems may represent a 
general mechanism by which cells exert spatiotemporal control over phase 
condensation processes.

The diverse functions of WASP, the deficiency of which causes Wiskott-Aldrich 
syndrome (WAS), remain poorly defined. We generated three isogenic WAS models 
using patient induced pluripotent stem cells and genome editing. These models 
recapitulated WAS phenotypes and revealed that WASP deficiency causes an 
upregulation of numerous RNA splicing factors and widespread altered splicing. 
Loss of WASP binding to splicing factor gene promoters frequently leads to 
aberrant epigenetic activation. WASP interacts with dozens of nuclear speckle 
constituents and constrains SRSF2 mobility. Using an optogenetic system, we 
showed that WASP forms phase-separated condensates that encompasses SRSF2, 
nascent RNA and active Pol II. The role of WASP in gene body condensates is 
corroborated by ChIPseq and RIPseq. Together our data reveal that WASP is a 
nexus regulator of RNA splicing that controls the transcription of splicing 
factors epigenetically and the dynamics of the splicing machinery through 
liquid-liquid phase separation.

1,2-Unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA), their corresponding N-oxides 
(PANO), and tropane alkaloids (TA) are toxic secondary plant metabolites. Their 
possible transfer into the milk of dairy cows has been studied in feeding 
trials; however, only few data on the occurrence of these toxins in milk are 
available. In this study, the development of a sensitive analytical approach for 
the simultaneous detection and quantification of a broad range of 54 PA/PANO as 
well as of the TA atropine and scopolamine in milk of dairy cows is presented. 
The method optimisation focused on sensitivity and separation of PA/PANO 
isomers. Milk samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction with aqueous 
formic acid and n-hexane, followed by a cation-exchange solid-phase extraction 
for purification. Reversed phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed using alkaline solvent conditions. Validation 
proved low limits of detection and quantification of 0.005 to 0.054 µg/L and of 
0.009 to 0.123 µg/L, respectively. For 51 of the 54 tested PA/PANO and both TA, 
the recovery rates ranged from 64 to 127% with repeatability (RSDr) values below 
15% at concentration levels of 0.05 and 0.50 µg/L and below 8% at a 
concentration level of 3.00 µg/L. Only three PANO did not match the validation 
criteria and were therefore regarded as semiquantitative. The final method was 
applied to 15 milk samples obtained from milk vending stations at farms and from 
local marketers in Bavaria, Germany. In three of the milk samples, traces of PA 
were detected.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Nauclea officinalis, a widely used Li medicine, 
has been used for the treatment of cold, fever, bronchitis, pneumonia, acute 
tonsillitis, and other ailments. Modern pharmacological studies have 
demonstrated that the most abundant and active components in N. officinalis are 
alkaloids, which possess various biological properties such as antibacterial and 
antitumor activities.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the phytochemical profile of a selected group 
of alkaloids from the N. officinalis total alkaloids, and to determine the 
chemical profile of the alkaloids extracted from rat plasma. Further 
investigation was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic behaviors of 11 
selected major alkaloids, including pumiloside, naucleoxoside A, naucleoxoside 
B, nauclefine, angustidine, angustoline, 
(3S,19S)-3,14-dihydroangustoline,[α]D20: (-)191°, 
(3S,19R)-3,14-dihydroangustoline, [α]D20: (-) 294.7°, strictosamide, angustine, 
and 3,14-dihydroangustine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: N. officinalis total alkaloids were extracted with 79% 
ethanol and enriched with AB-8 macroporous resin. The phytochemical profile of 
alkaloids from the N. officinalis total alkaloids and the chemical profile of 
the alkaloids extracted from rat plasma were first analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. 
A simple, convenient, and sensitive LC-ESI-MS/MS method was subsequently 
developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of major active 
alkaloids in rat plasma after oral administration of N. officinalis total 
alkaloids. After addition of an internal standard (verapamil), plasma samples 
were pretreated first by protein precipitation with methanol and then underwent 
liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was 
achieved using a Waters BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) at 30 °C, with 
gradient elution using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid aqueous 
solution (A) and acetonitrile (B), a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, and a total run 
time of 30 min. The detection was performed using an electrospray ionization 
triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer with multiple reaction monitoring and 
positive ionization mode.
RESULTS: Based on the fragmentation patterns of 11 authentic alkaloids and 
previous reports, 55 alkaloids were identified or tentatively identified in the 
N. officinalis total alkaloids. Among them, 25 alkaloids were absorbed through 
the gastrointestinal tract in rats after administration of the N. officinalis 
total alkaloids. The 11 alkaloids were selected for quantitative analysis. The 
established quantitative method was fully validated and proved to be sensitive 
and specific. Satisfactory linearity of the 11 alkaloids obtained in the 
respective concentration ranges (r > 0.9931). The lower limits of quantification 
for strictosamide was 20.86 ng/ml, and the other ten alkaloids were all less 
than 4.47 ng/ml in rat plasma. The intra-and inter-day precision was less than 
15% for all 11 alkaloids in terms of relative standard deviation, and the 
accuracies ranged from -11.4% to 11.1% in terms of relative error. Extraction 
recovery, matrix effect, and stability were within the required limits in rat 
plasma.
CONCLUSION: The validated method was successfully applied to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics of the 11 alkaloids in rat plasma after oral administration of 
N. officinalis total alkaloids. Eleven alkaloids were rapidly absorbed to 
achieve a maximum plasma concentration with Tmax from 0.25 h to 1.5 h after oral 
administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentration-time 
profiles will prove valuable in pre-clinical and clinical investigations on the 
disposition of N. officinalis total alkaloids.

AGGF1 is an angiogenic factor with G-Patch and FHA domains 1 described by our 
group. Gain-of-function mutations in AGGF1 cause Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, 
whereas somatic loss-of-function mutations cause cancer. Paraspeckles are small 
membraneless subnuclear structures with a diameter of 0.5-1 μm, and composed of 
lncRNA NEAT1 as the scaffold and three core RNA-binding proteins NONO, PSPC1, 
and PSF. Here, we show that AGGF1 is a key regulatory and structural component 
of paraspeckles that induces paraspeckle formation, forms an outside rim of 
paraspeckles, wraps around the NONO/PSF/PSPC1/NEAT1 core, and regulates the size 
and number of paraspeckles. AGGF1-paraspeckles are larger (>1 μm) than 
conventional paraspeckles. RNA-FISH in combination with immunostaining shows 
that AGGF1, NONO, and NEAT1_2 co-localize in 20.58% of NEAT1_2-positive 
paraspeckles. Mechanistically, AGGF1 interacts with NONO, PSF, and HNRNPK, and 
upregulates NEAT1_2, a longer, 23 kb NEAT1 transcript with a key role in 
regulation of paraspeckle size and number. RNA-immunoprecipitation shows that 
AGGF1 interacts with NEAT1, which may be another possible mechanism underlying 
the formation of AGGF1-paraspeckles. NEAT1_2 knockdown reduces the number and 
size of AGGF1-paraspeckles. Functionally, AGGF1 regulates alternative RNA 
splicing as it decreases the exon skipping/inclusion ratio in a CD44 model. 
AGGF1 is also localized in some nuclear foci without NEAT1 or NONO, suggesting 
that AGGF1 is an important liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) driver for 
other types of AGGF1-positive nuclear condensates (referred to as AGGF1-bodies). 
Our results identify a special type of AGGF1-coated paraspeckles and provide 
important insights into the formation, structure, and function of paraspeckles.

The microtubule cytoskeleton forms complex macromolecular assemblies with a 
range of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that have fundamental roles in 
cell architecture, division and motility. Determining how an individual MAP 
modulates microtubule behaviour is an important step in understanding the 
physiological roles of various microtubule assemblies. To characterize how MAPs 
control microtubule properties and functions, we developed an approach allowing 
for medium-throughput analyses of MAPs in cell-free conditions using lysates of 
mammalian cells. Our pipeline allows for quantitative as well as ultrastructural 
analyses of microtubule-MAP assemblies. Analysing 45 bona fide and potential 
mammalian MAPs, we uncovered previously unknown activities that lead to distinct 
and unique microtubule behaviours such as microtubule coiling or hook formation, 
or liquid-liquid phase separation along the microtubule lattice that initiates 
microtubule branching. We have thus established a powerful tool for a thorough 
characterization of a wide range of MAPs and MAP variants, thus opening avenues 
for the determination of mechanisms underlying their physiological roles and 
pathological implications.

A highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous detection of both 
simvastatin (SV) and simvastatin acid (SVA) in beagle plasma was developed and 
successfully applied to an absolute bioavailability study. Lovastatin (LV) was 
used as internal standard (IS). The analysis was performed using electrospray 
ionization and selective reaction monitoring in positive mode at m/z 
441.0 → 325.0 for SV, 459.0 → 343.0 for SVA and 427.0 → 325.0 for the IS, 
respectively. The assay procedure involved a simple liquid-liquid extraction of 
SV, SVA and LV from beagle plasma into methyl tert-butyl ether. Separation of 
SV, SVA and the IS was achieved on a Shim-pack VP-ODS column (150 × 2.0 mm, 
5 μm) with a binary gradient solvent system of 0.1% formic acid in water and 
methanol (15:85, v/v) as the mobile phase. The method was validated over the 
range of 0.25-500 ng/ml for SV (r2  ≥ 0.9923) and 0.24-481.23 ng/ml for SVA (r2 
 ≥ 0.9987). The results of method validation for accuracy, precision, extraction 
recovery, matrix effect and stability were within the acceptance criteria. The 
values of absolute bioavailability of SV and SVA in beagles were 2.97 and 
25.40%, respectively. It is the first study developed for the measurement of 
absolute bioavailability of SV and SVA acid in beagles.

Fyn is a Src kinase that controls critical signalling cascades and has been 
implicated in learning and memory. Postsynaptic enrichment of Fyn underpins 
synaptotoxicity in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal 
lobar degeneration with Tau pathology (FTLD-Tau). The FLTD P301L mutant Tau is 
associated with a higher propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) and form biomolecular condensates. Expression of P301L mutant Tau 
promotes aberrant trapping of Fyn in nanoclusters within hippocampal dendrites 
by an unknown mechanism. Here, we used single-particle tracking photoactivated 
localisation microscopy to demonstrate that the opening of Fyn into its primed 
conformation promotes its nanoclustering in dendrites leading to increased 
Fyn/ERK/S6 downstream signalling. Preventing the auto-inhibitory closed 
conformation of Fyn through phospho-inhibition or through perturbation of its 
SH3 domain increased Fyn's nanoscale trapping, whereas inhibition of the 
catalytic domain had no impact. By combining pharmacological and genetic 
approaches, we demonstrate that P301L Tau enhanced both Fyn nanoclustering and 
Fyn/ERK/S6 signalling via its ability to form biomolecular condensates. 
Together, our findings demonstrate that Fyn alternates between a closed and an 
open conformation, the latter being enzymatically active and clustered. 
Furthermore, pathogenic immobilisation of Fyn relies on the ability of P301L Tau 
to form biomolecular condensates, thus highlighting the critical importance of 
LLPS in controlling nanoclustering and downstream intracellular signalling 
events.

A rapid analytical method was developed and validated for the analysis of eight 
bound nitrofurans in animal tissue, shortening laboratory turnaround times from 
4 to 2 days. The majority of methodologies for nitrofuran analysis focus on the 
detection of only four drugs (nitrofurantoin, furazolidone, furaltadone and 
nitrofurazone), and is time-consuming given the 16-h overnight derivatisation 
step and a double liquid-liquid extraction. In this study, the narrow scope of 
analysis was addressed by including further four important nitrofuran drugs 
(nifursol, nitrofuroxazide, nifuraldezone and nitrovin). Full chromatographic 
separation was achieved for the metabolites of all eight nitrofurans, using 
phenyl-hexyl column chemistry and a rigorous optimisation of the mobile phase 
additives and gradient profile. The conventional, lengthy sample preparation was 
substantially shortened by replacing the traditional overnight water bath 
derivatisation with a rapid 2-h microwave-assisted reaction, followed by a 
modified-QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) extraction. 
This confirmatory method was fully validated in accordance with the new 
2021/808/EC legislation, and was shown to perform satisfactorily when applied to 
incurred tissues. The decision limit (CCα) for the eight analytes ranged between 
0.013 and 0.200 µg kg-1, showing abundant sensitivity given that the current RPA 
for nitrofurans is 0.5 µg kg-1. This innovative method can play a major role in 
the surveillance of the illegal use of nitrofuran drugs.

COVID-19 which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV-2) has posed a worldwide pandemic and a major global public health 
threat. SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein plays a critical role in multiple 
steps of the viral life cycle and participates in viral replication, 
transcription, and assembly. The primary roles of N protein are to assemble with 
genomic RNA into the viral RNA-protein (vRNP) complex and to localize to the 
replication transcription complexes (RTCs) to enhance viral replication and 
transcription. N protein can also undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 
with viral genome RNA and inhibit stress granules to facilitate viral 
replication and assembly. Besides the function in viral life cycle, N protein 
can bind GSDMD to antagonize pyroptosis but promotes cell death via the 
Smad3-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest mechanism. In innate immune system, N 
protein inhibits IFN-β production and RNAi pathway for virus survival. However, 
it can induce expression of proinflammatory cytokines by activating NF-κB 
signaling and NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in cytokine storms. In this review 
article, we are focusing on the signaling mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 N protein in 
viral replication, cell death and inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Loratadine (LTD) is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System II 
basic drug with pH-sensitive aqueous solubility and dissolution is a 
speed-limiting step of its absorption. The drug dissolution and the 
gastrointestinal tract pH conditions are likely to influence the in vivo 
pharmacokinetic behavior of LTD tablets.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A rapid, sensitive, and reliable bioanalytical method for 
simultaneous quantitation of LTD and its active metabolite desloratadine (DL) in 
beagle plasma was developed and validated based on liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sample preparation in low plasma consumption was 
accomplished by liquid-liquid extraction. The chromatographic separation was 
achieved on a Phenomenex Kinetex C8 column using acetonitrile and 5 mM ammonium 
formate as the mobile phase. A comparative pharmacokinetics study of three LTD 
tablets with different dissolution rates was conducted in male beagles in 
fasting state and an omeprazole-induced drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was 
subsequently performed under pretreatment of omeprazole.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The method showed a good linear correlation over the 
concentration ranges of 0.008-24 ng/mL for LTD and 0.8-800 ng/mL for DL, and was 
successfully applied to analyze the two compounds in beagle plasma. 
Pharmacokinetic results showed in the fasting state the three LTD tablets were 
equivalent in beagles in terms of effective components. DL of the three tablets 
were equivalent, indicating metabolite was less susceptible to pharmaceutic 
preparation factors for LTD tablets in beagles. Moreover, significant changes in 
LTD and DL pharmacokinetics parameters were observed under the effect of 
omeprazole-induced pH increase in gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that DDI 
effects are of concern for the curative effect of LTD when combined with 
omeprazole. The findings will contribute to the future pharmaceutical 
preparations research as well as the clinical application of LTD.

Pexidartinib is the first drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
specifically to treat the rare joint tumor tenosynovial giant cell tumor. In the 
current study, a validated, selective, and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS assay was 
developed for the quantitative determination of pexidartinib in plasma samples 
using gifitinib as an internal standard (IS). Pexidartinib and IS were extracted 
by liquid-liquid extraction using methyl tert-butyl ether and separated on an 
acquity BEH C18 column kept at 40 °C using a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid in 
acetonitrile: 0.1% formic acid in de-ionized water (70:30). The flow rate was 
0.25 mL/min. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was operated in electrospray 
(ESI)-positive mode at the ion transition of 418.06 > 165.0 for the analyte and 
447.09 > 128.0 for the IS. FDA guidance for bioanalytical method validation was 
followed in method validation. The linearity of the established UPLC-MS/MS assay 
ranged from 0.5 to 1000 ng/mL with r > 0.999 with a limit of quantitation of 0.5 
ng/mL. Moreover, the metabolic stability of pexidartinib in liver microsomes was 
estimated.

NUP98 fusion oncoproteins (FO) are drivers in pediatric leukemias and many 
transform hematopoietic cells. Most NUP98 FOs harbor an intrinsically disordered 
region from NUP98 that is prone to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in 
vitro. A predominant class of NUP98 FOs, including NUP98-HOXA9 (NHA9), retains a 
DNA-binding homeodomain, whereas others harbor other types of DNA- or 
chromatin-binding domains. NUP98 FOs have long been known to form puncta, but 
long-standing questions are how nuclear puncta form and how they drive 
leukemogenesis. Here we studied NHA9 condensates and show that homotypic 
interactions and different types of heterotypic interactions are required to 
form nuclear puncta, which are associated with aberrant transcriptional activity 
and transformation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We also show that 
three additional leukemia-associated NUP98 FOs (NUP98-PRRX1, NUP98-KDM5A, and 
NUP98-LNP1) form nuclear puncta and transform hematopoietic cells. These 
findings indicate that LLPS is critical for leukemogenesis by NUP98 FOs.
SIGNIFICANCE: We show that homotypic and heterotypic mechanisms of LLPS control 
NUP98-HOXA9 puncta formation, modulating transcriptional activity and 
transforming hematopoietic cells. Importantly, these mechanisms are 
generalizable to other NUP98 FOs that share similar domain structures. These 
findings address long-standing questions on how nuclear puncta form and their 
link to leukemogenesis. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue 
feature, p. 873.

Understanding the dissolution mechanisms of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) 
and being able to link enhanced drug exposure with process parameters are key 
when formulating poorly soluble compounds. Thus, in this study, ASDs composed by 
itraconazole (ITZ) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) 
were formulated with different polymer grades and drug loads (DLs) and processed 
by spray drying with different atomization ratios and outlet temperatures. Their 
in vitro performance and the ability to form drug-rich colloids were then 
evaluated by a physiologically relevant dissolution method. In gastric media, 
drug release followed a diffusion-controlled mechanism and drug-rich colloids 
were not formed since the solubility of the amorphous API at pH 1.6 was not 
exceeded. After changing to intestinal media, the API followed a polymer 
dissolution-controlled release, where the polymer rapidly dissolved, promoting 
the immediate release of API and thus leading to liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS) and consequent formation of drug-rich colloids. However, the release of 
API and polymer was not congruent, so API surface enrichment occurred, which 
limited the further dissolution of the polymer, leading to a drug-controlled 
release. ASDs formulated with M-grade showed the highest ability to maintain 
supersaturation and the lowest tendency for AAPS due to its good balance between 
acetyl and succinoyl groups, and thus strong interactions with both the 
hydrophobic drug and the aqueous dissolution medium. The ability to form 
colloids increased for low DL (15%) and high specific surface area due to the 
high amount of polymer released until the occurrence of API surface enrichment. 
Even though congruent release was not observed, all ASDs formed drug-rich 
colloids that were stable in the solution until the end of the dissolution study 
(4 h), maintaining the same size distribution (ca. 300 nm). Drug-rich colloids 
can, in vivo, act as a drug reservoir replenishing the drug while it permeates. 
Designing ASDs that are prone to form colloids can overcome the solubility 
constraints of Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) II and IV drugs, 
posing as a reliable formulation strategy.

N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) are important 
regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. Recently, it was found that m6 A is 
closely related to APA. However, the molecular mechanism of this new APA 
regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that YTHDC1, a nuclear m6 A reader, 
can suppress proximal APA sites and produce longer 3' UTR transcripts by binding 
to their upstream m6 A sites. YTHDC1 can directly interact with the 3' end 
processing factor FIP1L1 and interfere with its ability to recruit CPSF4. 
Binding to the m6 A sites can promote liquid-liquid phase separation of YTHDC1 
and FIP1L1, which may play an important role in their interaction and APA 
regulation. Collectively, YTHDC1 as an m6 A "reader" links m6 A modification 
with pre-mRNA 3' end processing, providing a new mechanism for APA regulation.

Naturally inspired proteins are investigated for the development of bioglues 
that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical 
applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the 
proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that a 
new generation of protein-based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly 
through de novo designed structural proteins in which arginine triggers robust 
liquid-liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly 
strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to 
ultrastrong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted 
and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enable quick visceral hemostasis 
in 10 s and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good 
biocompatibility, and superior antibacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum 
inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical 
antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo 
designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically 
strong protein-based materials for surgical applications.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer targeting diagnostic agent with effective imaging 
ability is important in guiding plan formulation, prediction, and curative 
effect evaluation of tumors in clinic. A tumor-targeting nanoprobe based on the 
functional and programmable Liquid-Liquid phase separation of AS1411 promoted by 
Ru(II) complex RuPEP may develop into a potential phosphorescence probe to 
detect breast cancer cells, where AS1411 act as a tumor-targeting guidance 
moiety to distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and RuPEP act as a 
light-emitting element to highlight breast cancer cells.
METHODS: Here we designed and constructed a nanoprobe AS1411@RuPEP, and the 
physicochemical and biochemical properties were characterized by TEM, AFM and 
EDS. The breast cancer targeting diagnostic capacity was evaluated by 
normal/tumor cell co-culture assay, tumor cells targeting tracking in xenograft 
model and cancerous area selectively distinguishing in human patient tissue.
RESULTS: Further studies indicated that the nanoprobe exhibits excellent 
tumor-targeting imaging ability in vitro and in vivo by effectively recognize 
the over-expressed nucleolin (NCL) on the breast cancer cells membrane. 
Intriguingly, we discovered that the selectively enrichment of nanoprobe 
particles in tumor cells is related to ATP-dependent NCL transport processes 
that rely on the AS1411 component of nanoprobe to recognize NCL. Furthermore, 
preferential accumulation of nanoprobe is clearly differentiating the human 
breast cancer tissue surrounding non-cancerous tissue in histological analysis.
CONCLUSION: This study produce a potent nanoprobe can be used as a convenient 
tool to highlight and distinguish tumor cells in vivo, and indicate the tumorous 
grading and staging in human breast cancer patient pathological section, which 
provides an effective way for breast cancer diagnostic imaging by targeting 
recognize NCL.

Wnt signal transduction is controlled by the destruction complex (DC), a 
condensate comprising scaffold proteins and kinases that regulate β-catenin 
stability. Overexpressed DC scaffolds undergo liquid-liquid phase separation 
(LLPS), but DC mesoscale organization at endogenous expression levels and its 
role in β-catenin processing were previously unknown. Here, we find that DC LLPS 
is nucleated by the centrosome. Through a combination of CRISPR-engineered 
custom fluorescent tags, finite element simulations, and optogenetic tools that 
allow for manipulation of DC concentration and multivalency, we find that 
centrosomal nucleation drives processing of β-catenin by colocalizing DC 
components to a single reaction crucible. Enriching GSK3β partitioning on the 
centrosome controls β-catenin processing and prevents Wnt-driven embryonic stem 
cell differentiation to mesoderm. Our findings demonstrate the role of 
nucleators in controlling biomolecular condensates and suggest tight integration 
between Wnt signal transduction and the cell cycle.

The transcription factor NF-κB, which plays an important role in cell fate 
determination, is involved in the activation of super-enhancers (SEs). However, 
the biological functions of the NF-κB SEs in gene control are not fully 
elucidated. We investigated the characteristics of NF-κB-mediated SE activity 
using fluorescence imaging of RelA, single-cell transcriptome and chromatin 
accessibility analyses in anti-IgM-stimulated B cells. The formation of cell 
stimulation-induced nuclear RelA foci was abolished in the presence of 
hexanediol, suggesting an underlying process of liquid-liquid phase separation. 
The gained SEs induced a switch-like expression and enhanced cell-to-cell 
variability in transcriptional response. These properties were correlated with 
the number of gained cis-regulatory interactions, while switch-like gene 
induction was associated with the number of NF-κB binding sites in SE. Our study 
suggests that NF-κB SEs have an important role in the transcriptional regulation 
of B cells possibly through liquid condensate formation consisting of 
macromolecular interactions.

In this study, we report the development and validation of an LC-tandem mass 
spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantitation of bendamustine and 
copanlisib in mouse plasma as per the US FDA regulatory guidelines. The sample 
processing involves extraction of bendamustine and copanlisib along with 
internal standard (IS; warfarin) from 50 μL mouse plasma using a liquid-liquid 
extraction method. The chromatographic separation of bendamustine, copanlisib 
and the IS was achieved on an Atlantis dC18 column using an isocratic mobile 
phase (5 mM ammonium acetate:methanol, 20:80 v/v). Bendamustine, copanlisib and 
the IS eluted at 0.88, 1.39 and 0.74 min, respectively, with a total run time of 
2.5 min. The calibration curve ranged from 3.99-2996 and 4.33-3248 ng/mL for 
bendamustine and copanlisib, respectively. Inter- and intra-day precision and 
accuracy, stability in processed samples and upon storage, dilution integrity 
and incurred sample reanalysis were investigated for both the analytes. The 
intra- and inter-day precisions were in the ranges of 2.01%-5.05% and 
2.74%-6.13% and 1.98%-7.64 and 8.62%-9.04% for bendamustine and copanlisib, 
respectively. Stability studies showed that both analytes were stable on bench 
top for 6 h, in auto-sampler for 24 and at -80°C for 30 days. The validated 
method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in mice.

BACKGROUND: Multi-steroid profiling is a powerful analytical tool that 
simultaneously quantifies steroids from different biosynthetic pathways. Here we 
present an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-MS/MS) assay for the profiling of 23 steroids using post-column infusion 
of ammonium fluoride.
METHODS: Following liquid-liquid extraction, steroids were chromatographically 
separated over 5 min using a Phenomenex Luna Omega C18 column and a water (0.1 % 
formic acid) methanol gradient. Quantification was performed on a Waters Acquity 
UHPLC and Xevo® TQ-XS mass spectrometer. Ammonium fluoride (6 mmol/L, 
post-column infusion) and formic acid (0.1 % (vol/vol), mobile phase additive) 
were compared as additives to aid ionisation.
RESULTS: Post-column infusion of ammonium fluoride enhanced ionisation in a 
steroid structure-dependent fashion compared to formic acid (122-140 % for 
3βOH-Δ5 steroids and 477-1274 % for 3-keto-Δ4 steroids). Therefore, we 
analytically validated post-column infusion of ammonium fluoride. Lower limits 
of quantification ranged from 0.3 to 3 nmol/L; All analytes were quantifiable 
with acceptable accuracy (bias range -14 % to 11.9 % for 21/23, -21 % to 11.9 % 
for all analytes). Average recovery ranged from 91.6 % to 113.6 % and average 
matrix effects from -29.9 % to 19.9 %. Imprecision ranged from 2.3 % to 23 % for 
all analytes and was < 15 % for 18/23 analytes. The serum multi-steroid profile 
of 10 healthy men and 10 healthy women was measured.
CONCLUSIONS: UHPLC-MS/MS with post-column infusion of ammonium fluoride enables 
comprehensive multi-steroid profiling through enhanced ionisation particularly 
benefiting the detection of 3-keto-Δ4 steroids.

A rapid, simple, and economical method has been developed to determine 
colchicine in both human whole blood and urine using UPLC-MS/MS. Colchicine and 
isotope-labeled internal standard were extracted from the matrix by 
liquid-liquid extraction with saturated borax and ethyl acetate, and separated 
by a reversed-phase chromatography C18 column. Gradient elution was carried out 
using acetonitrile and water spiked with 0.01% formic acid. Multiple reaction 
monitoring was performed at positive ion mode. The quantitative transitions were 
m/z 400.27 → 310.28 for colchicine and m/z 406.16 → 313.18 for colchicine-D6. 
The method has good linearity in the range of 0.5-200 ng/mL for blood and 
2-2000 ng/mL for urine. The sensitivity, accuracy, and matrix effect were all in 
line with the guidelines of Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines 
Agency. The extraction recovery was above 63.94%. The samples were stable under 
various storage conditions. Six deuterium-substituted isotopic internal standard 
was used to demonstrate a different mode of colchicine cleavage from the 
existing literature. This method has been successfully used in the diagnosis of 
patients with colchicine poisoning. Blood is recommended as the optimal sample 
compared with urine.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have a high 
ability of liquid-liquid phase separation, which enables its incorporation into 
stress granules (SGs) of host cells. However, whether SG invasion by N protein 
occurs in the scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknow, neither do we know its 
consequence. Here, we used SARS-CoV-2 to infect mammalian cells and observed the 
incorporation of N protein into SGs, which resulted in markedly impaired 
self-disassembly but stimulated cell cellular clearance of SGs. NMR experiments 
further showed that N protein binds to the SG-related amyloid proteins via 
non-specific transient interactions, which not only expedites the phase 
transition of these proteins to aberrant amyloid aggregation in vitro, but also 
promotes the aggregation of FUS with ALS-associated P525L mutation in cells. In 
addition, we found that ACE2 is not necessary for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to 
mammalian cells. Our work indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can impair the 
disassembly of host SGs and promote the aggregation of SG-related amyloid 
proteins, which may lead to an increased risk of neurodegeneration.

Sorafenib (SOR), an inhibitor of multiple kinases, is a classic targeted drug 
for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which often coexists with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin (DAPA), a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitor (SGLT2i), is widely used in patients with T2DM. Notably, 
co-administration of SOR with DAPA is common in clinical settings. Uridine 
diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A9 (UGT1A9) is involved in 
the metabolism of SOR and dapagliflozin (DAPA), and SOR is the inhibitor of 
UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 (in vitro). Therefore, changes in UGT1A9 activity caused by 
SOR may lead to pharmacokinetic interactions between the two drugs. The 
objective of the current study was to develop an ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous 
determination of SOR and DAPA in plasma and to evaluate the effect of the 
co-administration of SOR and DAPA on their individual pharmacokinetic properties 
and the mechanism involved. The rats were divided into four groups: SOR (100 
mg/kg) alone and co-administered with DAPA (1 mg/kg) for seven days, and DAPA (1 
mg/kg) alone and co-administered with SOR (100 mg/kg) for seven days. 
Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was performed for plasma sample preparation, and 
the chromatographic separation was conducted on Waters XSelect HSS T3 column 
with a gradient elution of 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium acetate (Phase A) 
and acetonitrile (Phase B). The levels of Ugt1a7 messenger RNA (mRNA) were 
determined in rat liver and intestine using quantitative real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The method was successfully applied to the study of 
pharmacokinetic interactions. DAPA caused a significant decrease in the maximum 
plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time 
curves (AUC0-t) of SOR by 41.6% and 50.5%, respectively, while the apparent 
volume of distribution (Vz/F) and apparent clearance (CLz/F) significantly 
increased 2.85- and 1.98-fold, respectively. When co-administering DAPA with 
SOR, the AUC0-t and the elimination half-life (t1/2Z) of DAPA significantly 
increased 1.66- and 1.80-fold, respectively, whereas the CLz/F significantly 
decreased by 40%. Results from qRT-PCR showed that, compared with control, seven 
days of SOR pretreatment decreased Ugt1a7 expression in both liver and intestine 
tissue. In contrast, seven days of DAPA pretreatment decreased Ugt1a7 expression 
only in liver tissue. Therefore, pharmacokinetic interactions exist between 
long-term use of SOR with DAPA, and UGT1A9 may be the targets mediating the 
interaction. Active surveillance for the treatment outcomes and adverse 
reactions are required.

Ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry (UPLC/ESI/MS/MS) for the concomitant quantification of active plant 
constituents, namely quercetin and piperine, in rat plasma was developed and 
validated to assess pharmacokinetics after a single oral administration. 
Liquid-liquid extraction technique with ethyl acetate and n-hexane (1 : 1) was 
used, and fisetin was added as an internal standard (IS). Effective 
chromatographic separation of quercetin, piperine and IS was executed on a 
Waters Acquity BEH C18 column (50.0 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) using formic acid both 
(0.1% w/v) in water (A) and acetonitrile (B) as the mobile phase in gradient 
mode. For detection purposes, positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode was 
used with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode for estimation using [M + H]+ 
fragment ions m/z 303.04 → 152.9 for quercetin, 286.12 → 201.04 for piperine and 
287.01 → 136.93 for IS. The method was linear over the calibration range of 
0.1-200 ng mL-1. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of quercetin and 
piperine was obtained as 0.1 ng mL-1 in rat plasma, along with negligible matrix 
effect and acceptable stability. Furthermore, the bioanalytical method was 
successfully implemented to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of 
quercetin-and piperine-enriched nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) in rat 
plasma after oral administration. The enhancement in the oral bioavailability of 
quercetin and piperine was 20.72 and 4.67 fold, respectively, compared to their 
native pristine dispersions. Future exploration of the concentrations of these 
active constituents in human plasma and organs is feasible using this sensitive, 
validated UPLC/ESI/MS/MS method.

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions 
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ubiquitin-positive 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) can 
dimerise/oligomerise with the head-to-tail arrangement, which is essential for 
function but also favours liquid-liquid phase separation and inclusion formation 
of full-length TDP-43. Using various biophysical approaches, we identified an 
alternative conformational state of NTD in the presence of Sulfobetaine 3-10 
(SB3-10), with higher content of α-helical structure and tryptophan solvent 
exposure. NMR shows a highly mobile structure, with partially folded regions and 
β-sheet content decrease, with a concomitant increase of α-helical structure. It 
is monomeric and reverts to native oligomeric NTD upon SB3-10 dilution. The 
equilibrium GdnHCl-induced denaturation shows a cooperative folding and a 
somewhat lower conformational stability. When the aggregation processes were 
compared with and without pre-incubation with SB3-10, but at the identical final 
SB3-10 concentration, a slower aggregation was found in the former case, despite 
the reversible attainment of the native conformation in both cases. This was 
attributed to protein monomerization and oligomeric seeds disruption by the 
conditions promoting the alternative conformation. Overall, the results show a 
high plasticity of TDP-43 NTD and identify strategies to monomerise TDP-43 NTD 
for methodological and biomedical applications.

As a critical node for insulin/IGF signaling, insulin receptor substrate 1 
(IRS-1) is essential for metabolic regulation. A long and unstructured 
C-terminal region of IRS-1 recruits downstream effectors for promoting 
insulin/IGF signals. However, the underlying molecular basis for this remains 
elusive. Here, we found that the C-terminus of IRS-1 undergoes liquid-liquid 
phase separation (LLPS). Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were 
seen to drive IRS-1 LLPS. Self-association of IRS-1, which was mainly mediated 
by the 301-600 region, drives IRS-1 LLPS to form insulin/IGF-1 signalosomes. 
Moreover, tyrosine residues of YXXM motifs, which recruit downstream effectors, 
also contributed to IRS-1 self-association and LLPS. Impairment of IRS-1 LLPS 
attenuated its positive effects on insulin/IGF-1 signaling. The metabolic 
disease-associated G972R mutation impaired the self-association and LLPS of 
IRS-1. Our findings delineate a mechanism in which LLPS of IRS-1-mediated 
signalosomes serves as an organizing center for insulin/IGF-1 signaling and 
implicate the role of aberrant IRS-1 LLPS in metabolic diseases.

Almost twenty years after its initial release, the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) 
resource remains an invaluable source of information for the study of 
motif-mediated protein-protein interactions. ELM provides a comprehensive, 
regularly updated and well-organised repository of manually curated, 
experimentally validated short linear motifs (SLiMs). An increasing number of 
SLiM-mediated interactions are discovered each year and keeping the resource 
up-to-date continues to be a great challenge. In the current update, 30 novel 
motif classes have been added and five existing classes have undergone major 
revisions. The update includes 411 new motif instances mostly focused on 
cell-cycle regulation, control of the actin cytoskeleton, membrane remodelling 
and vesicle trafficking pathways, liquid-liquid phase separation and integrin 
signalling. Many of the newly annotated motif-mediated interactions are targets 
of pathogenic motif mimicry by viral, bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens, 
providing invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 
infectious diseases. The current ELM release includes 317 motif classes 
incorporating 3934 individual motif instances manually curated from 3867 
scientific publications. ELM is available at: http://elm.eu.org.

Disturbance of macrophage-associated lipid metabolism plays a key role in 
atherosclerosis. Crosstalk between autophagy deficiency and inflammation 
response in foam cells (FCs) through epigenetic regulation is still poorly 
understood. Here, we demonstrate that in macrophages, oxidized low-density 
lipoprotein (ox-LDL) leads to abnormal crosstalk between autophagy and 
inflammation, thereby causing aberrant lipid metabolism mediated through a 
dysfunctional transcription factor EB (TFEB)-P300-bromodomain-containing protein 
4 (BRD4) axis. ox-LDL led to macrophage autophagy deficiency along with TFEB 
cytoplasmic accumulation and increased reactive oxygen species generation. This 
activated P300 promoted BRD4 binding on the promoter regions of inflammatory 
genes, consequently contributing to inflammation with atherogenesis. 
Particularly, ox-LDL activated BRD4-dependent super-enhancer associated with 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) on the regulatory regions of inflammatory 
genes. Curcumin (Cur) prominently restored FCs autophagy by promoting TFEB 
nuclear translocation, optimizing lipid catabolism, and reducing inflammation. 
The consequences of P300 and BRD4 on super-enhancer formation and inflammatory 
response in FCs could be prevented by Cur. Furthermore, the anti-atherogenesis 
effect of Cur was inhibited by macrophage-specific Brd4 overexpression or Tfeb 
knock-out in Apoe knock-out mice via bone marrow transplantation. The findings 
identify a novel TFEB-P300-BRD4 axis and establish a new epigenetic paradigm by 
which Cur regulates autophagy, inhibits inflammation, and decreases lipid 
content.

A selective and rapid ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was established and validated for the 
determination of ziyuglycoside I, 3β,19α-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic-acid 
28-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, and pomolic acid in rats after the oral 
administration of ziyuglycoside I, 3β,19α-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic-acid 
28-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, pomolic acid, and Sanguisorba officinalis L. 
extract. The separation was carried out on an ACQUITY UPLC®HSS T3 column (2.1 mm 
× 100 mm, 1.8 μm), using methanol and 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate water as the 
mobile phase. The three compounds were quantified using the multiple reaction 
monitoring mode with the electrospray ion source in both the positive and 
negative mode. Liquid-liquid extraction was applied to the plasma sample 
preparation. Bifendate was selected as the internal standard. The intra-day and 
inter-day precision and the accuracy of the method were all within receivable 
ranges. The lower limit of quantification of ziyuglycoside I, 
3β,19α-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic-acid 28-β-d-glucopyranosyl ester, and pomolic 
acid were 6.50, 5.75, and 2.63 ng/mL, respectively. The extraction recoveries of 
analytes in rat plasma ranged from 83 to 94%. The three components could be 
rapidly absorbed into the blood (Tmax, 1.4-1.6 h) both in the 
single-administration group or S. officinalis extract group, but the first peak 
of PA occurred at 0.5 h and the second peak at 4-5 h in the S. officinalis 
extract. Three compounds were eliminated relatively slowly (t1/2, 7.3-11 h). The 
research was to establish a rapid, sensible, and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method 
using the multi-ion mode for multi-channel simultaneous mensuration 
pharmacokinetics parameters of three compounds in rats after oral administration 
of S. officinalis extract. This study found, for the first time, differences in 
the pharmacokinetic parameters of the three compounds in the monomer compounds 
and S. officinalis extract administration, which preliminarily revealed the 
transformation and metabolism of the three compounds in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a highly 
selective and sensitive method for the quantification of kinase inhibitors, yet 
not widely available in clinical routine for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). 
To provide a more accessible alternative, a high-performance liquid 
chromatography method with ultraviolet/diode array detection (HPLC-UV/DAD) to 
quantify cabozantinib, dabrafenib, nilotinib and osimertinib, was developed and 
validated. Results were compared to LC-MS/MS.
METHOD: After liquid-liquid-extraction and reconstitution of the residue in 
20 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) (pH4.6), acetonitrile and methanol 
(50:25:25,v/v/v), chromatographic separation was achieved in 20.0 min using a 
Luna® C18(2)-HST column (100 × 2 mm, 2.5 μm), protected by a C18 guard column 
(4 × 2 mm) (column temperature: 30 °C, autosampler: 10 °C). Mobile phase A and B 
consisted of 20 mM KH2PO4 (pH4.9) and acetonitrile (9:1,v/v) and 
acetonitrile:20 mM KH2PO4 (pH4.9) (7:3,v/v), respectively. Gradient elution was 
performed at 200 µL/min. Analytes were quantified at 250, 280 and 330 nm, using 
sorafenib as internal standard.
RESULTS: Calibration curves were linear (35-2,000 ng/mL). Method validation 
assays met requirements by U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European 
Medicines Agency. Compared to the more sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS, 
HPLC-UV/DAD showed a good correlation and a strong positive association 
(Kendall's tau 0.811¬-0.963, p < 0.05). Bland-Altman-plots revealed 100% 
(cabozantinib), 98.6% (dabrafenib), 98.6% (nilotinib) and 96.2% (osimertinib) of 
relative differences inside the limits of agreement. Regulatory agency criteria 
for sample reanalysis and cross validation were met (±20%-criterion:100% 
(cabozantinib), 94.3% (dabrafenib), 92% (nilotinib) and 84.6% (osimertinib).
CONCLUSION: The developed HPLC-UV/DAD method is "fit-for-TDM" in clinical 
routine and serves as a genuine alternative to LC-MS/MS.

A simple, rapid and sensitive analytical method was developed for the 
determination of toosendanin in rat plasma using liquid chromatography tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Andrographolide was selected as the internal 
standard, and the plasma samples were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with 
diethyl ether. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Dikma Spursil C18, 
3.5 μm (150 × 2.1 mm i.d) analytical column with 85% methanol:water (v/v) 
containing 0.025% formic acid (pH = 3.9) as mobile phase. The flow rate was 
0.25 mL/min, and the total run time was 3 min. Detection was performed with a 
triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer using negative ion mode electrospray 
ionization (ESI) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS/MS ion 
transitions monitored were m/z 573.1 → 531.1 and 349.0 → 287.0 for toosendanin 
and andrographolide, respectively. Good linearity was observed over the 
concentration range of 3.125-500 ng/mL in 100 μL of rat plasma with a 
correlation coefficient ˃0.9997. Intra- and inter-assay variabilities were ˂8.5% 
in plasma. The recovery and the matrix effect were in the range 71.8-73.5% and 
96.4-103.8%, respectively. The analyte was stable under various conditions (at 
room temperature, during freeze-thaw settings, in the autosampler, and under 
deep-freeze conditions). The method was successfully applied to a 
pharmacokinetic study of toosendanin after its oral administration in rats at a 
dose of 10 mg/kg.

IBP (2,6-diisobornyl-4-methylphenol) is a small drug molecule with antioxidant 
properties considered to be a promising neuro-, cardio-, and retinoprotective 
agent. In this study, a bioanalytical LC-MS/MS method for its determination in 
rat plasma was developed using 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime as an 
internal standard (IS). The analytes were extracted from plasma by liquid-liquid 
extraction technique using isopropyl alcohol:chloroform mixture (1:5, v/v) 
followed by evaporation and reconstitution of the residues in acetonitrile. The 
chromatographic separation was carried out on the EC Nucleodur C8 ec column 
(150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) under an isocratic elution mode using acetonitrile and 
water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (97:3, v/v) as a mobile phase at a flow 
rate of 0.55 mL/min (40 °C). The IS and IBP were eluted at 3.79 ± 0.02 and 
6.30 ± 0.02 min, respectively. The total analysis time was 7.00 min. Multiple 
reaction monitoring was used to conduct the MS/MS detection in the negative ion 
mode with transitions at m/z 245.9 → 214.9 (IS) and 379.2 → 256.0 (IBP). 
Validation studies of the developed method revealed good linearity over the 
range of 10-5,000 ng/mL. Within- and between-run accuracy was in the range of 
92-110%, while within- and between-run precision was below 8%. Additionally, low 
matrix effects and high recovery (above 98%) were observed. IBP remained stable 
in rat plasma at room temperature for 4 h, at -80 °C for 21 days, over three 
freeze-thaw cycles, under vacuum concentrator (45 °C, dried residues) and 
auto-sampler (15 °C, processed samples) temperatures for 1 h and 24 h, 
respectively. Subsequently, the validated LC-MS/MS method has been successfully 
applied to quantitate IBP in actual plasma samples after a single oral, 
intramuscular, and subcutaneous dose of IBP (10 mg/kg in the peach oil) to rats. 
Pharmacokinetic studies show that more rapid and complete IBP absorption with a 
satisfactory excretion rate were observed after oral administration route 
compared to the intramuscular and subcutaneous ones.

The Jumonji domain-containing protein JMJD6 is a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent 
dioxygenase associated with a broad range of biological functions. Cellular 
studies have implicated the enzyme in chromatin biology, transcription, DNA 
repair, mRNA splicing, and cotranscriptional processing. Although not all 
studies agree, JMJD6 has been reported to catalyze both hydroxylation of lysine 
residues and demethylation of arginine residues. However, despite extensive 
study and indirect evidence for JMJD6 catalysis in many cellular processes, 
direct assignment of JMJD6 catalytic substrates has been limited. Examination of 
a reported site of proline hydroxylation within a lysine-rich region of the 
tandem bromodomain protein BRD4 led us to conclude that hydroxylation was in 
fact on lysine and catalyzed by JMJD6. This prompted a wider search for 
JMJD6-catalyzed protein modifications deploying mass spectrometric methods 
designed to improve the analysis of such lysine-rich regions. Using lysine 
derivatization with propionic anhydride to improve the analysis of tryptic 
peptides and nontryptic proteolysis, we report 150 sites of JMJD6-catalyzed 
lysine hydroxylation on 48 protein substrates, including 19 sites of 
hydroxylation on BRD4. Most hydroxylations were within lysine-rich regions that 
are predicted to be unstructured; in some, multiple modifications were observed 
on adjacent lysine residues. Almost all of the JMJD6 substrates defined in these 
studies have been associated with membraneless organelle formation. Given the 
reported roles of lysine-rich regions in subcellular partitioning by 
liquid-liquid phase separation, our findings raise the possibility that JMJD6 
may play a role in regulating such processes in response to stresses, including 
hypoxia.

Roxadustat (FG-4592) can inhibit the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 
(HIF-PH) enzymes that are responsible for targeting and regulating HIF for 
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. It has been approved in China as an 
anti-anemia drug for treating the anemia in dialysis-dependent CKD (chronic 
kidney disease) patients, and is also under regulatory review in Japan. Some 
studies are also investigating the clinical pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of roxadustat in CKD patients. To support clinical 
investigations, a rapid high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method, with a concentration range from 1 to 
5000 ng/mL, was designed for the quantification of roxadustat in human plasma 
and urine. Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was applied to sample clean-up 
followed by a chromatographic separation conducted on a Waters XTerra Phenyl 
column with isocratic elution. The mixture consisting of 
acetonitrile/water/formic acid (60:40:0.1[%], v/v/v) was employed as the mobile 
phase (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min) with 60% post-column split. The quantitation was 
employed in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode based on positive 
electrospray ionization (ESI). This proposed method was fully validated and 
applied to the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study of roxadustat 
among healthy subjects in China.

Biogenesis of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) includes the formation of the 
permeability barrier composed of phenylalanine-glycine-rich nucleoporins 
(FG-Nups) that regulate the selective passage of biomolecules across the nuclear 
envelope. The FG-Nups are intrinsically disordered and prone to liquid-liquid 
phase separation and aggregation when isolated. How FG-Nups are protected from 
making inappropriate interactions during NPC biogenesis is not fully understood. 
Here we find that DNAJB6, a molecular chaperone of the heat shock protein 
network, forms foci in close proximity to NPCs. The number of these foci 
decreases upon removal of proteins involved in the early steps of interphase NPC 
biogenesis. Conversely, when this process is stalled in the last steps, the 
number of DNAJB6-containing foci increases and these foci are identified as 
herniations at the nuclear envelope. Immunoelectron tomography shows that DNAJB6 
localizes inside the lumen of the herniations arising at NPC biogenesis 
intermediates. Loss of DNAJB6 results in the accumulation of cytosolic annulate 
lamellae, which are structures containing partly assembled NPCs, a feature 
associated with disturbances in NPC biogenesis. We find that DNAJB6 binds to 
FG-Nups and can prevent the aggregation of the FG region of several FG-Nups in 
cells and in vitro. Together, our data show that the molecular chaperone DNAJB6 
provides quality control during NPC biogenesis and is involved in the 
surveillance of native intrinsically disordered FG-Nups.

The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) is a multifunctional promiscuous nucleic 
acid-binding protein, which plays a major role in nucleocapsid assembly and 
discontinuous RNA transcription, facilitating the template switch of 
transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Here, we dissect the structural 
features of the N protein N-terminal domain (N-NTD) and N-NTD plus the SR-rich 
motif (N-NTD-SR) upon binding to single and double-stranded TRS DNA, as well as 
their activities for dsTRS melting and TRS-induced liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS). Our study gives insights on the specificity for N-NTD(-SR) 
interaction with TRS. We observed an approximation of the triple-thymidine (TTT) 
motif of the TRS to β-sheet II, giving rise to an orientation difference of ~25° 
between dsTRS and non-specific sequence (dsNS). It led to a local unfavorable 
energetic contribution that might trigger the melting activity. The 
thermodynamic parameters of binding of ssTRSs and dsTRS suggested that the 
duplex dissociation of the dsTRS in the binding cleft is entropically favorable. 
We showed a preference for TRS in the formation of liquid condensates when 
compared to NS. Moreover, our results on DNA binding may serve as a starting 
point for the design of inhibitors, including aptamers, against N, a possible 
therapeutic target essential for the virus infectivity.

OBJECTIVE: A sensitive and rapid ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was successfully 
applied to the determination of 10 alkaloids in beagle dog plasma following a 
single oral dose of Xiatianwu capsules and enteric-coated capsules, with 
theophylline serving as the internal standard (IS).
METHODS: Plasma samples were preprocessed using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) 
with ethyl acetate ahead to separation using a gradient elution procedure on a 
Waters ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (1.8 μm, 100 × 2.1 mm). The mobile phase was 
composed of 0.1% formic acid solution and acetonitrile at the flow rate of 
0.3 ml/min. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to determine the 
analytes in the positive ion mode.
RESULTS: The calibration curves for 10 analytes demonstrated a high degree of 
linearity (r ≥ 0.9920). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values for 10 
alkaloids were all more than 1.074 ng/ml, and matrix effects varied from 94.25% 
to 106.15%. The mean extraction recovery of quality control samples at low 
(LQC), medium (MQC) and high (HQC) concentrations, as well as IS, was all more 
than 76.60%. The intra-day and inter-day precision (RSD) also satisfied the 
requirement. Simultaneously, the variation of assay accuracies (RE) was between 
13.05% and 9.38%.
CONCLUSION: The test was validated in accordance with regulatory bioanalytical 
guidelines and was found to be suitable for use in a pharmacokinetic 
investigation of these compounds in beagle dogs after oral administration of 
Xiatianwu general capsules and enteric-coated capsules. The Cmax of 10 alkaloids 
ranged from 52.61 to 192.46 ng/ml after oral administration of Xiatianwu 
capsules, and from 67.50 to 247.36 ng/ml. The Tmax was between 0.59 and 1.33 h 
of Xiatianwu capsules, and between 1.08 and 2.00 h of enteric-coated capsules. 
The t1/2 ranged from 3.18 to 7.47 h of general capsules, and from 6.01 to 
11.36 h. AUC0-t ranged from 181.06 to 722.74 ng·h/ml of Xiatianwu capsules, and 
from 275.03 to 884.17 ng·h/ml of enteric-coated capsules. The Cmax of 
enteric-coated capsules were significantly increased except for 
tetrahydropalmatine and berberine. Tmax of general capsules were less than 1 h, 
and of enteric-coated capsules were less than 2 h. The t1/2 of 
dehydrocorydaline, palmatine, tetrahydrojatrorrhizine, jatrorrhizine and 
coptisine in enteric-coated capsules was longer than that in ordinary capsule. 
The AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of bicuculline, dehydrocorydaline, protopine, 
magnoflorine, tetrahydrojatrorrhizine, jatrorrhizine, berberine and coptisine 
were all significantly higher in enteric-coated capsules.
