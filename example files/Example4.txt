DAVID is a popular bioinformatics resource system including a web server and web 
service for functional annotation and enrichment analyses of gene lists. It 
consists of a comprehensive knowledgebase and a set of functional analysis 
tools. Here, we report all updates made in 2021. The DAVID Gene system was 
rebuilt to gain coverage of more organisms, which increased the taxonomy 
coverage from 17 399 to 55 464. All existing annotation types have been updated, 
if available, based on the new DAVID Gene system. Compared with the last 
version, the number of gene-term records for most annotation types within the 
updated Knowledgebase have significantly increased. Moreover, we have 
incorporated new annotations in the Knowledgebase including small molecule-gene 
interactions from PubChem, drug-gene interactions from DrugBank, tissue 
expression information from the Human Protein Atlas, disease information from 
DisGeNET, and pathways from WikiPathways and PathBank. Eight of ten subgroups 
split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were assigned to specific types. Finally, 
we added a species parameter for uploading a list of gene symbols to minimize 
the ambiguity between species, which increases the efficiency of the list upload 
and eliminates confusion for users. These current updates have significantly 
expanded the Knowledgebase and enhanced the discovery power of DAVID.

Most complex disease-associated loci mapped by genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS) are located in non-coding regions. It remains elusive which genes the 
associated loci regulate and in which tissues/cell types the regulation occurs. 
Here, we present PCGA (https://pmglab.top/pcga), a comprehensive web server for 
jointly estimating both associated tissues/cell types and susceptibility genes 
for complex phenotypes by GWAS summary statistics. The web server is built on 
our published method, DESE, which represents an effective method to mutually 
estimate driver tissues and genes by integrating GWAS summary statistics and 
transcriptome data. By collecting and processing extensive bulk and single-cell 
RNA sequencing datasets, PCGA has included expression profiles of 54 human 
tissues, 2,214 human cell types and 4,384 mouse cell types, which provide the 
basis for estimating associated tissues/cell types and genes for complex 
phenotypes. We develop a framework to sequentially estimate associated tissues 
and cell types of a complex phenotype according to their hierarchical 
relationships we curated. Meanwhile, we construct a phenotype-cell-gene 
association landscape by estimating the associated tissues/cell types and genes 
of 1,871 public GWASs. The association landscape is generally consistent with 
biological knowledge and can be searched and browsed at the PCGA website.

In the era of life-omics, huge amounts of multi-omics data have been generated 
and widely used in biomedical research. It is challenging for biologists with 
limited programming skills to obtain biological insights from multi-omics data. 
Thus, a biologist-oriented platform containing visualization functions is needed 
to make complex omics data digestible. Here, we propose an easy-to-use, 
interactive web server named ExpressVis. In ExpressVis, users can prepare 
datasets; perform differential expression analysis, clustering analysis, and 
survival analysis; and integrate expression data with protein-protein 
interaction networks and pathway maps. These analyses are organized into six 
modules. Users can use each module independently or use several modules 
interactively. ExpressVis displays analysis results in interactive figures and 
tables, and provides comprehensive interactive operations in each figure and 
table, between figures or tables in each module, and among different modules. It 
is freely accessible at https://omicsmining.ncpsb.org.cn/ExpressVis and does not 
require login. To test the performance of ExpressVis for multi-omics studies of 
clinical cohorts, we re-analyzed a published hepatocellular carcinoma dataset 
and reproduced their main findings, suggesting that ExpressVis is convenient 
enough to analyze multi-omics data. Based on its complete analysis processes and 
unique interactive operations, ExpressVis provides an easy-to-use solution for 
exploring multi-omics data.

The AlignMe web server is dedicated to accurately aligning sequences of membrane 
proteins, a particularly challenging task due to the strong evolutionary 
divergence and the low compositional complexity of hydrophobic membrane-spanning 
proteins. AlignMe can create pairwise alignments of either two primary amino 
acid sequences or two hydropathy profiles. The web server for AlignMe has been 
continuously available for >10 years, supporting 1000s of users per year. Recent 
improvements include anchoring, multiple submissions, and structure 
visualization. Anchoring is the ability to constrain a position in an alignment, 
which allows expert information about related residues in proteins to be 
incorporated into an alignment without manual modification. The original web 
interface to the server limited the user to one alignment per submission, 
hindering larger scale studies. Now, batches of alignments can be initiated with 
a single submission. Finally, to provide structural context for the relationship 
between proteins, sequence similarity can now be mapped onto one or more 
structures (or structural models) of the proteins being aligned, by links to 
MutationExplorer, a web-based visualization tool. Together with a refreshed user 
interface, these features further enhance an important resource in the membrane 
protein community. The AlignMe web server is freely available at 
https://www.bioinfo.mpg.de/AlignMe/.

RSAT (Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools) enables the detection and the analysis 
of cis-regulatory elements in genomic sequences. This software suite performs 
(i) de novo motif discovery (including from genome-wide datasets like 
ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq) (ii) genomic sequences scanning with known motifs, (iii) 
motif analysis (quality assessment, comparisons and clustering), (iv) analysis 
of regulatory variations and (v) comparative genomics. RSAT comprises 50 tools. 
Six public Web servers (including a teaching server) are offered to meet the 
needs of different biological communities. RSAT philosophy and originality are: 
(i) a multi-modal access depending on the user needs, through web forms, 
command-line for local installation and programmatic web services, (ii) a 
support for virtually any genome (animals, bacteria, plants, totalizing over 10 
000 genomes directly accessible). Since the 2018 NAR Web Software Issue, we have 
developed a large REST API, extended the support for additional genomes and 
external motif collections, enhanced some tools and Web forms, and developed a 
novel tool that builds or refine gene regulatory networks using motif scanning 
(network-interactions). The RSAT website provides extensive documentation, 
tutorials and published protocols. RSAT code is under open-source license and 
now hosted in GitHub. RSAT is available at http://www.rsat.eu/.

Modeling 3D genome organisation has been booming in the last years thanks to the 
availability of experimental datasets of genomic contacts. However, the field is 
currently missing the standardisation of methods and metrics to compare 
predictions and experiments. We present 3DGenBench, a web server available at 
https://inc-cost.eu/benchmarking/, that allows benchmarking computational models 
of 3D Genomics. The benchmark is performed using a manually curated dataset of 
39 capture Hi-C profiles in wild type and genome-edited mouse cells, and five 
genome-wide Hi-C profiles in human, mouse, and Drosophila cells. 3DGenBench 
performs two kinds of analysis, each supplied with a specific scoring module 
that compares predictions of a computational method to experimental data using 
several metrics. With 3DGenBench, the user obtains model performance scores, 
allowing an unbiased comparison with other models. 3DGenBench aims to become a 
reference web server to test new 3D genomics models and is conceived as an 
evolving platform where new types of analysis will be implemented in the future.

Here we present ICARUS, a web server to enable users without experience in R to 
undertake single cell RNA-seq analysis. The focal point of ICARUS is its 
intuitive tutorial-style user interface, designed to guide logical navigation 
through the multitude of pre-processing, analysis and visualization steps. 
ICARUS is easily accessible through a dedicated web server 
(https://launch.icarus-scrnaseq.cloud.edu.au/) and avoids installation of 
software on the user's computer. Notable features include the facility to apply 
quality control thresholds and adjust dimensionality reduction and cell 
clustering parameters. Data is visualized through 2D/3D UMAP and t-SNE plots and 
may be curated to remove potential confounders such as cell cycle heterogeneity. 
ICARUS offers flexible differential expression analysis with user-defined cell 
groups and gene set enrichment analysis to identify likely affected biological 
pathways. Eleven organisms including human, dog, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit 
fly, nematode, yeast, cattle, chicken and pig are currently supported. 
Visualization of multimodal data including those generated by CITE-seq and the 
10X Genomics Multiome kit is included. ICARUS incorporates a function to save 
the current state of analysis avoiding computationally intensive steps during 
repeat analysis. The complete analysis of a typical single cell RNA-seq dataset 
by inexperienced users may be achieved in 1-2 h.

Most bacteria and archaea possess multiple antiviral defence systems that 
protect against infection by phages, archaeal viruses and mobile genetic 
elements. Our understanding of the diversity of defence systems has increased 
greatly in the last few years, and many more systems likely await discovery. To 
identify defence-related genes, we recently developed the Prokaryotic Antiviral 
Defence LOCator (PADLOC) bioinformatics tool. To increase the accessibility of 
PADLOC, we describe here the PADLOC web server (freely available at 
https://padloc.otago.ac.nz), allowing users to analyse whole genomes, 
metagenomic contigs, plasmids, phages and archaeal viruses. The web server 
includes a more than 5-fold increase in defence system types detected (since the 
first release) and expanded functionality enabling detection of CRISPR arrays 
and retron ncRNAs. Here, we provide user information such as input options, 
description of the multiple outputs, limitations and considerations for 
interpretation of the results, and guidance for subsequent analyses. The PADLOC 
web server also houses a precomputed database of the defence systems 
in > 230,000 RefSeq genomes. These data reveal two taxa, Campylobacterota and 
Spriochaetota, with unusual defence system diversity and abundance. Overall, the 
PADLOC web server provides a convenient and accessible resource for the 
detection of antiviral defence systems.

Biomedical researchers take advantage of high-throughput, high-coverage 
technologies to routinely generate sets of genes of interest across a wide range 
of biological conditions. Although these technologies have directly shed light 
on the molecular underpinnings of various biological processes and diseases, the 
list of genes from any individual experiment is often noisy and incomplete. 
Additionally, interpreting these lists of genes can be challenging in terms of 
how they are related to each other and to other genes in the genome. In this 
work, we present GenePlexus (https://www.geneplexus.net/), a web-server that 
allows a researcher to utilize a powerful, network-based machine learning method 
to gain insights into their gene set of interest and additional functionally 
similar genes. Once a user uploads their own set of human genes and chooses 
between a number of different human network representations, GenePlexus provides 
predictions of how associated every gene in the network is to the input set. The 
web-server also provides interpretability through network visualization and 
comparison to other machine learning models trained on thousands of known 
process/pathway and disease gene sets. GenePlexus is free and open to all users 
without the need for registration.

Circadian rhythms are a foundational aspect of biology. These rhythms are found 
at the molecular level in every cell of every living organism and they play a 
fundamental role in homeostasis and a variety of physiological processes. As a 
result, biomedical research of circadian rhythms continues to expand at a rapid 
pace. To support this research, CircadiOmics (http://circadiomics.igb.uci.edu/) 
is the largest annotated repository and analytic web server for high-throughput 
omic (e.g. transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic) circadian time series 
experimental data. CircadiOmics contains over 290 experiments and over 100 
million individual measurements, across >20 unique tissues/organs, and 11 
different species. Users are able to visualize and mine these datasets by 
deriving and comparing periodicity statistics for oscillating molecular species 
including: period, amplitude, phase, P-value and q-value. These statistics are 
obtained from BIO_CYCLE and JTK_CYCLE and are intuitively aggregated and 
displayed for comparison. CircadiOmics is the most up-to-date and cutting-edge 
web portal for searching and analyzing circadian omic data and is used by 
researchers around the world.

Long distance enhancers can physically interact with promoters to regulate gene 
expression through formation of enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. 
Identification of E-P interactions is also important for profound understanding 
of normal developmental and disease-associated risk variants. Although the 
state-of-art predictive computation methods facilitate the identification of E-P 
interactions to a certain extent, currently there is no efficient method that 
can meet various requirements of usage. Here we developed EPIXplorer, a 
user-friendly web server for efficient prediction, analysis and visualization of 
E-P interactions. EPIXplorer integrates 9 robust predictive algorithms, supports 
multiple types of 3D contact data and multi-omics data as input. The output from 
EPIXplorer is scored, fully annotated by regulatory elements and risk 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the Visualization and 
Downstream module provide further functional analysis, all the output files and 
high-quality images are available for download. Together, EPIXplorer provides a 
user-friendly interface to predict the E-P interactions in an acceptable time, 
as well as understand how the genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants 
influence disease pathology by altering DNA looping between enhancers and the 
target gene promoters. EPIXplorer is available at 
https://www.csuligroup.com/EPIXplorer.

Proteins in food and personal care products can pose a risk for an immediate 
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic response. Bioinformatic tools can 
assist to predict and investigate the allergenic potential of proteins. Here we 
present AllerCatPro 2.0, a web server that can be used to predict protein 
allergenicity potential with better accuracy than other computational methods 
and new features that help assessors making informed decisions. AllerCatPro 2.0 
predicts the similarity between input proteins using both their amino acid 
sequences and predicted 3D structures towards the most comprehensive datasets of 
reliable proteins associated with allergenicity. These datasets currently 
include 4979 protein allergens, 162 low allergenic proteins, and 165 autoimmune 
allergens with manual expert curation from the databases of WHO/International 
Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS), Comprehensive Protein Allergen Resource 
(COMPARE), Food Allergy Research and Resource Program (FARRP), UniProtKB and 
Allergome. Various examples of profilins, autoimmune allergens, low allergenic 
proteins, very large proteins, and nucleotide input sequences showcase the

Accurate inference of gene regulatory networks (GRN) is an essential component 
of systems biology, and there is a constant development of new inference 
methods. The most common approach to assess accuracy for publications is to 
benchmark the new method against a selection of existing algorithms. This often 
leads to a very limited comparison, potentially biasing the results, which may 
stem from tuning the benchmark's properties or incorrect application of other 
methods. These issues can be avoided by a web server with a broad range of data 
properties and inference algorithms, that makes it easy to perform comprehensive 
benchmarking of new methods, and provides a more objective assessment. Here we 
present https://GRNbenchmark.org/ - a new web server for benchmarking GRN 
inference methods, which provides the user with a set of benchmarks with several 
datasets, each spanning a range of properties including multiple noise levels. 
As soon as the web server has performed the benchmarking, the accuracy results 
are made privately available to the user via interactive summary plots and 
underlying curves. The user can then download these results for any purpose, and 
decide whether or not to make them public to share with the community.

The CFM-ID 4.0 web server (https://cfmid.wishartlab.com) is an online tool for 
predicting, annotating and interpreting tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra of small 
molecules. It is specifically designed to assist researchers pursuing studies in 
metabolomics, exposomics and analytical chemistry. More specifically, CFM-ID 4.0 
supports the: 1) prediction of electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight 
tandem mass spectra (ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) for small molecules over multiple collision 
energies (10 eV, 20 eV, and 40 eV); 2) annotation of ESI-QTOF-MS/MS spectra 
given the structure of the compound; and 3) identification of a small molecule 
that generated a given ESI-QTOF-MS/MS spectrum at one or more collision 
energies. The CFM-ID 4.0 web server makes use of a substantially improved MS 
fragmentation algorithm, a much larger database of experimental and in silico 
predicted MS/MS spectra and improved scoring methods to offer more accurate 
MS/MS spectral prediction and MS/MS-based compound identification. Compared to 
earlier versions of CFM-ID, this new version has an MS/MS spectral prediction 
performance that is ∼22% better and a compound identification accuracy that is 
∼35% better on a standard (CASMI 2016) testing dataset. CFM-ID 4.0 also features 
a neutral loss function that allows users to identify similar or substituent 
compounds where no match can be found using CFM-ID's regular MS/MS-to-compound 
identification utility. Finally, the CFM-ID 4.0 web server now offers a much 
more refined user interface that is easier to use, supports molecular formula 
identification (from MS/MS data), provides more interactively viewable data 
(including proposed fragment ion structures) and displays MS mirror plots for 
comparing predicted with observed MS/MS spectra. These improvements should make 
CFM-ID 4.0 much more useful to the community and should make small molecule 
identification much easier, faster, and more accurate.

5NosoAE is a webserver that can be used for nosocomial bacterial analysis 
including the identification of similar strains based on antimicrobial 
resistance profiles (antibiogram) and the spatiotemporal distribution 
visualization and phylogenetic analysis of identified strains with similar 
antibiograms. The extensive use of antibiotics has caused many pathogenic 
bacteria to develop multiple drug resistance, resulting in clinical infection 
treatment challenges and posing a major threat to global public health. Relevant 
studies have investigated the key determinants of antimicrobial resistance in 
the whole-genome sequence of bacteria. However, a web server is currently not 
available for performing large-scale strain searches according to antimicrobial 
resistance profiles and visualizing epidemiological information including the 
spatiotemporal distribution, antibiogram heatmap, and phylogeny of identified 
strains. Here, we implemented these functions in the new server, referred to as 
5NosoAE. This server accepts the genome sequence file in the FASTA format of 
five nosocomial bacteria, namely Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus 
aureus for query. All visualizations are implemented in JavaScript and PHP. This 
server will be useful for physicians and epidemiologists involved in research on 
infectious disease. The 5NosoAE platform is available at 
https://nosoae.imst.nsysu.edu.tw.

Residue coevolution within and between proteins is used as a marker of physical 
interaction and/or residue functional cooperation. Pairs or groups of coevolving 
residues are extracted from multiple sequence alignments based on a variety of 
computational approaches. However, coevolution signals emerging in subsets of 
sequences might be lost if the full alignment is considered. iBIS2Analyzer is a 
web server dedicated to a phylogeny-driven coevolution analysis of protein 
families with different evolutionary pressure. It is based on the iterative 
version, iBIS2, of the coevolution analysis method BIS, Blocks in Sequences. 
iBIS2 is designed to iteratively select and analyse subtrees in phylogenetic 
trees, possibly large and comprising thousands of sequences. With iBIS2Analyzer, 
openly accessible at http://ibis2analyzer.lcqb.upmc.fr/, the user visualizes, 
compares and inspects clusters of coevolving residues by mapping them onto 
sequences, alignments or structures of choice, greatly simplifying downstream 
analysis steps. A rich and interactive graphic interface facilitates the 
biological interpretation of the results.

BioTransformer 3.0 (https://biotransformer.ca) is a freely available web server 
that supports accurate, rapid and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction. 
It combines machine learning approaches with a rule-based system to predict 
small-molecule metabolism in human tissues, the human gut as well as the 
external environment (soil and water microbiota). Simply stated, BioTransformer 
takes a molecular structure as input (SMILES or SDF) and outputs an 
interactively sortable table of the predicted metabolites or transformation 
products (SMILES, PNG images) along with the enzymes that are predicted to be 
responsible for those reactions and richly annotated downloadable files (CSV and 
JSON). The entire process typically takes less than a minute. Previous versions 
of BioTransformer focused exclusively on predicting the metabolism of 
xenobiotics (such as plant natural products, drugs, cosmetics and other 
synthetic compounds) using a limited number of pre-defined steps and somewhat 
limited rule-based methods. BioTransformer 3.0 uses much more sophisticated 
methods and incorporates new databases, new constraints and new prediction 
modules to not only more accurately predict the metabolic transformation 
products of exogenous xenobiotics but also the transformation products of 
endogenous metabolites, such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, organic 
acids, and lipids. BioTransformer 3.0 can also support customized sequential 
combinations of these transformations along with multiple iterations to simulate 
multi-step human biotransformation events. Performance tests indicate that 
BioTransformer 3.0 is 40-50% more accurate, far less prone to combinatorial 
'explosions' and much more comprehensive in terms of metabolite 
coverage/capabilities than previous versions of BioTransformer.

Multi-CSAR is a web server that can efficiently and more accurately order and 
orient the contigs in the assembly of a target genome into larger scaffolds 
based on multiple reference genomes. Given a target genome and multiple 
reference genomes, Multi-CSAR first identifies sequence markers shared between 
the target genome and each reference genome, then utilizes these sequence 
markers to compute a scaffold for the target genome based on each single 
reference genome, and finally combines all the single reference-derived 
scaffolds into a multiple reference-derived scaffold. To run Multi-CSAR, the 
users need to upload a target genome to be scaffolded and one or more reference 
genomes in multi-FASTA format. The users can also choose to use the 'weighting 
scheme of reference genomes' for Multi-CSAR to automatically calculate different 
weights for the reference genomes and choose either 'NUCmer on nucleotides' or 
'PROmer on translated amino acids' for Multi-CSAR to identify sequence markers. 
In the output page, Multi-CSAR displays its multiple reference-derived scaffold 
in two graphical representations (i.e. Circos plot and dotplot) for the users to 
visually validate the correctness of scaffolded contigs and in a tabular 
representation to further validate the scaffold in detail. Multi-CSAR is 
available online at http://genome.cs.nthu.edu.tw/Multi-CSAR/.

Protein structure is key to understanding biological function. Structure 
comparison deciphers deep phylogenies, providing insight into functional 
conservation and functional shifts during evolution. Until recently, structural 
coverage of the protein universe was limited by the cost and labour involved in 
experimental structure determination. Recent breakthroughs in deep learning 
revolutionized structural bioinformatics by providing accurate structural models 
of numerous protein families for which no structural information existed. The 
Dali server for 3D protein structure comparison is widely used by 
crystallographers to relate new structures to pre-existing ones. Here, we report 
two most recent upgrades to the web server: (i) the foldomes of key organisms in 
the AlphaFold Database (version 1) are searchable by Dali, (ii) structural 
alignments are annotated with protein families. Using these new features, we 
discovered a novel functionally diverse subgroup within the WRKY/GCM1 clan. This 
was accomplished by linking the structurally characterized SWI/SNF and NAM 
families as well as the structural models of the CG-1 family and uncharacterized 
proteins to the structure of Gti1/Pac2, a previously known member of the 
WRKY/GCM1 clan. The Dali server is available at 
http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali. This website is free and open to all 
users and there is no login requirement.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has been successfully applied to 
clinically therapeutics in multiple cancers, but its efficacy varies greatly 
among different patients and cancer types. Therefore, the construction of gene 
signatures to identify patients who could benefit from ICB therapy is 
particularly important for precision cancer treatment. However, due to the lack 
of a user-friendly platform, the construction of such gene signatures is a great 
challenge for clinical investigators who have limited programming skills. In 
light of this challenge, we developed a web server called Tumor Immunotherapy 
Response Signature Finder(TIRSF) for the construction of gene signatures to 
predict ICB therapy response in cancer patients. TIRSF consists of three 
functional modules. The first module is the Signature Discovery module which 
provides signature construction and performance evaluation functionalities. The 
second is a module for response prediction based on the TIRSF signatures, which 
enables response prediction and prognostic analysis of immunotherapy samples. 
The last is a module for response prediction based on existing signatures. This 
module currently integrates 24 published signatures for ICB therapy response 
prediction. Together, all of above features can be freely accessed at 
http://tirsf.renlab.org/.

Understanding the functions and origins of proteins requires splitting these 
macromolecules into fragments that could be independent in terms of folding, 
activity, or evolution. For that purpose, structural domains are the typical 
level of analysis, but shorter segments, such as subdomains and supersecondary 
structures, are insightful as well. Here, we propose SWORD2, a web server for 
exploring how an input protein structure may be decomposed into 'Protein Units' 
that can be hierarchically assembled to delimit structural domains. For each 
partitioning solution, the relevance of the identified substructures is 
estimated through different measures. This multilevel analysis is achieved by 
integrating our previous work on domain delineation, 'protein peeling' and model 
quality assessment. We hope that SWORD2 will be useful to biologists searching 
for key regions in their proteins of interest and to bioinformaticians building 
datasets of protein structures. The web server is freely available online:

With the proliferation of genomic sequence data for biomedical research, the 
exploration of human genetic information by domain experts requires a 
comprehensive interrogation of large numbers of scientific publications in 
PubMed. However, a query in PubMed essentially provides search results sorted 
only by the date of publication. A search engine for retrieving and interpreting 
complex relations between biomedical concepts in scientific publications remains 
lacking. Here, we present pubmedKB, a web server designed to extract and 
visualize semantic relationships between four biomedical entity types: variants, 
genes, diseases, and chemicals. pubmedKB uses state-of-the-art natural language 
processing techniques to extract semantic relations from the large number of 
PubMed abstracts. Currently, over 2 million semantic relations between 
biomedical entity pairs are extracted from over 33 million PubMed abstracts in 
pubmedKB. pubmedKB has a user-friendly interface with an interactive semantic 
graph, enabling the user to easily query entities and explore entity relations. 
Supporting sentences with the highlighted snippets allow to easily navigate the 
publications. Combined with a new explorative approach to literature mining and 
an interactive interface for researchers, pubmedKB thus enables rapid, 
intelligent searching of the large biomedical literature to provide useful 
knowledge and insights. pubmedKB is available at https://www.pubmedkb.cc/.

Recent advances in the field of high throughput (meta-)transcriptomics and 
proteomics call for easy and rapid methods enabling to explore not only single 
genes or proteins but also extended biological systems. Gene set enrichment 
analysis is commonly used to find relations in a set of genes and helps to 
uncover the biological meaning in results derived from high-throughput data. The 
basis for gene set enrichment analysis is a solid functional classification of 
genes. Here, we describe a comprehensive database containing multiple functional 
classifications of genes of all (>55 000) publicly available complete bacterial 
genomes. In addition to the most common functional classes such as COG and GO, 
also KEGG, InterPro, PFAM, eggnog and operon classes are supported. As 
classification data for features is often not available, we offer fast 
annotation and classification of proteins in any newly sequenced bacterial 
genome. The web server FUNAGE-Pro enables fast functional analysis on single 
gene sets, multiple experiments, time series data, clusters, and gene network 
modules for any prokaryote species or strain. FUNAGE-Pro is freely available at 
http://funagepro.molgenrug.nl.

ABC portal (http://abc.sklehabc.com) is a database and web portal containing 198 
single-cell transcriptomic datasets of development, differentiation and disorder 
of blood/immune cells. All the datasets were re-annotated with a manually 
curated and unified single-cell reference, especially for the haematopoietic 
stem and progenitor cells. ABC portal provides web-based interactive analysis 
modules, especially a comprehensive cell-cell communication analysis and 
disease-related gene signature analysis. Importantly, ABC portal allows 
customized sample selection based on a combination of several metadata for 
downstream analysis and comparison analysis across datasets. ABC portal also 
allows users to select multiple cell types for analysis in the modules. 
Together, ABC portal provides an interactive interface of single-cell data 
exploration and re-analysis with customized analysis modules for the researchers 
and clinicians, and will facilitate understanding of haematopoiesis and 
blood/immune disorders.

Extensive amounts of data from next-generation sequencing and omics studies have 
led to the accumulation of information that provides insight into the 
evolutionary landscape of related proteins. Here, we present OrthoQuantum, a web 
server that allows for time-efficient analysis and visualization of phylogenetic 
profiles of any set of eukaryotic proteins. It is a simple-to-use tool capable 
of searching large input sets of proteins. Using data from open source databases 
of orthologous sequences in a wide range of taxonomic groups, it enables users 
to assess coupled evolutionary patterns and helps define lineage-specific 
innovations. The web interface allows to perform queries with gene names and 
UniProt identifiers in different phylogenetic clades and supplement presence 
with an additional BLAST search. The conservation patterns of proteins are coded 
as binary vectors, i.e., strings that encode the presence or absence of 
orthologous proteins in other genomes. These strings are used to calculate 
top-scoring correlation pairs needed for finding co-inherited proteins which are 
simultaneously present or simultaneously absent in specific lineages. Profiles 
are visualized in combination with phylogenetic trees in a JavaScript-based 
interface. The OrthoQuantum v1.0 web server is freely available at 
http://orthoq.bioinf.fbb.msu.ru along with documentation and tutorial.

In recent years great progress has been made in identification of structural 
variants (SV) in the human genome. However, the interpretation of SVs, 
especially located in non-coding DNA, remains challenging. One of the reasons 
stems in the lack of tools exclusively designed for clinical SVs evaluation 
acknowledging the 3D chromatin architecture. Therefore, we present TADeus2 a web 
server dedicated for a quick investigation of chromatin conformation changes, 
providing a visual framework for the interpretation of SVs affecting 
topologically associating domains (TADs). This tool provides a convenient visual 
inspection of SVs, both in a continuous genome view as well as from a 
rearrangement's breakpoint perspective. Additionally, TADeus2 allows the user to 
assess the influence of analyzed SVs within flaking coding/non-coding regions 
based on the Hi-C matrix. Importantly, the SVs pathogenicity is quantified and 
ranked using TADA, ClassifyCNV tools and sampling-based P-value. TADeus2 is 
publicly available at https://tadeus2.mimuw.edu.pl.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables the identification of functional 
nucleic acid sequences from in vitro selection/evolution experiments and 
illuminates the evolutionary process at single-nucleotide resolution. However, 
analyzing the vast output from NGS can be daunting, especially with limited 
programming skills. We developed REVERSE (Rapid EValuation of Experimental RNA 
Selection/Evolution) (https://www.reverseserver.org/), a web server that 
implements an integrated computational pipeline through a graphical user 
interface, which performs both pre-processing and detailed sequence level 
analyses within minutes. Raw FASTQ files are quality-filtered, dereplicated, and 
trimmed before being analyzed by either of two pipelines. The first pipeline 
counts, sorts, and tracks enrichment of unique sequences and user-defined 
sequence motifs. It also identifies mutational intermediates present in the 
sequence data that connect two input sequences. The second pipeline sorts 
similar sequences into clusters and tracks enrichment of peak sequences. It also 
performs nucleotide conservation analysis on the cluster of choice and generates 
a consensus sequence. Both pipelines generate downloadable spreadsheets and 
high-resolution figures. Collectively, REVERSE is a one-stop solution for the 
rapid analysis of NGS data obtained from in vitro selection/evolution 
experiments that obviates the need for computational expertise.

pH regulates protein function and interactions by altering the charge of 
individual residues causing loss or gain of intramolecular noncovalent bonds, 
which may lead to structural rearrangements. While tools to analyze 
residue-specific charge distribution of proteins at a given pH exist, currently 
no tool is available to investigate noncovalent bond changes at two different pH 
values. To make protein pH sensitivity analysis more accessible, we developed 
patcHwork, a web server that combines the identification of amino acids 
undergoing a charge shift with the determination of affected noncovalent bonds 
at two user-defined pH values. At the sequence-only level, patcHwork applies the 
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine pH-sensitive residues. When the 3D 
protein structure is available, patcHwork can be employed to gain mechanistic 
understanding of the effect of pH. This is achieved using the PDB2PQR and PROPKA 
tools and noncovalent bond determination algorithms. A user-friendly interface 
allows visualizing pH-sensitive residues, affected salt bridges, hydrogen bonds 
and aromatic (pi-pi and cation-pi) interactions. patcHwork can be used to 
identify patches, a new concept we propose of pH-sensitive residues in close 
proximity on the protein, which may have a major impact on function. We 
demonstrate the attractiveness of patcHwork studying experimentally investigated 
pH-sensitive proteins (https://patchwork.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/).

Upon the ever-increasing number of publicly available experimentally determined 
and predicted protein and nucleic acid structures, the demand for easy-to-use 
tools to investigate these structural models is higher than ever before. The 
ProteinsPlus web server (https://proteins.plus) comprises a growing collection 
of molecular modeling tools focusing on protein-ligand interactions. It enables 
quick access to structural investigations ranging from structure analytics and 
search methods to molecular docking. It is by now well-established in the 
community and constantly extended. The server gives easy access not only to 
experts but also to students and occasional users from the field of life 
sciences. Here, we describe its recently added new features and tools, beyond 
them a novel method for on-the-fly molecular docking and a search method for 
single-residue substitutions in local regions of a protein structure throughout 
the whole Protein Data Bank. Finally, we provide a glimpse into new avenues for 
the annotation of AlphaFold structures which are directly accessible via a 
RESTful service on the ProteinsPlus web server.

It is of vital importance to understand the population structure, dissect the 
genetic bases of performance traits, and make proper strategies for selection in 
breeding programs. However, there is no single webserver covering the specific 
needs in aquaculture. We present Aquaculture Molecular Breeding Platform (AMBP), 
the first web server for genetic data analysis in aquatic species of farming 
interest. AMBP integrates the haplotype reference panels of 18 aquaculture 
species, which greatly improves the accuracy of genotype imputation. It also 
supports multiple tools to infer genetic structures, dissect the genetic 
architecture of performance traits, estimate breeding values, and predict 
optimum contribution. All the tools are coherently linked in a web-interface for 
users to generate interpretable results and evaluate statistical 
appropriateness. The webserver supports standard VCF and PLINK (PED, MAP) files, 
and implements automated pipelines for format transformation and visualization 
to simplify the process of analysis. As a demonstration, we applied the 
webserver to Pacific white shrimp and Atlantic salmon datasets. In summary, AMBP 
constitutes comprehensive resources and analytical tools for exploring genetic 
data and guiding practical breeding programs. AMBP is available at 
http://mgb.qnlm.ac.

Advances in experimental and computational techniques enable the exploration of 
large and complex RNA 3D structures. These, in turn, reveal previously unstudied 
properties and motifs not characteristic for small molecules with simple 
architectures. Examples include entanglements of structural elements in RNA 
molecules and knot-like folds discovered, among others, in the genomes of RNA 
viruses. Recently, we presented the first classification of entanglements, 
determined by their topology and the type of entangled structural elements. 
Here, we introduce RNAspider - a web server to automatically identify, classify, 
and visualize primary and higher-order entanglements in RNA tertiary structures. 
The program applies to evaluate RNA 3D models obtained experimentally or by 
computational prediction. It supports the analysis of uncommon topologies in the 
pseudoknotted RNA structures. RNAspider is implemented as a publicly available 
tool with a user-friendly interface and can be freely accessed at 
https://rnaspider.cs.put.poznan.pl/.

The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology has provided a simple yet powerful 
system for genome editing. Current gRNA design tools serve as an important 
platform for the efficient application of the CRISPR systems. However, most of 
the existing tools are black-box models that suffer from limitations, such as 
variable performance and unclear mechanism of decision making. Here, we 
introduce CRISPRedict, an interpretable gRNA efficiency prediction model for 
CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Its strength lies in the fact that it can accurately 
predict efficient guide RNAs-with equivalent performance to state-of-the-art 
tools-while being a simple linear model. Implemented as a user-friendly web 
server, CRISPRedict offers (i) quick and accurate predictions across various 
experimental conditions (e.g. U6/T7 transcription); (ii) regression and 
classification models for scoring gRNAs and (iii) multiple visualizations to 
explain the obtained results. Given its performance, interpretability, and 
versatility, we expect that it will assist researchers in the gRNA design 
process and facilitate genome editing research. CRISPRedict is available for use 
at http://www.crispredict.org/.

Recent high-throughput omics techniques have produced a large amount of 
biological data. Visualization of big omics data is essential to answer a wide 
range of biological problems. As a concise but comprehensive strategy, a heatmap 
can analyze and visualize high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomolecular 
expression data in an attractive artwork. In 2014, we developed a stand-alone 
software package, Heat map Illustrator (HemI 1.0), which implemented three 
clustering methods and seven distance metrics for heatmap illustration. Here, we 
significantly improved 1.0 and released the online service of HemI 2.0, in which 
7 clustering methods and 22 types of distance metrics were implemented. In HemI 
2.0, the clustering results and publication-quality heatmaps can be exported 
directly. For an in-depth analysis of the data, we further added an option of 
enrichment analysis for 12 model organisms, with 15 types of functional 
annotations. The enrichment results can be visualized in five idioms, including 
bubble chart, bar graph, coxcomb chart, pie chart and word cloud. We anticipate 
that HemI 2.0 can be a helpful web server for visualization of biomolecular 
expression data, as well as the additional enrichment analysis. HemI 2.0 is 
freely available for all users at: https://hemi.biocuckoo.org/.

In order to uncover the meanings of 'book of life', 155 different biological 
language models (BLMs) for DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis are discussed 
in this study, which are able to extract the linguistic properties of 'book of 
life'. We also extend the BLMs into a system called BioSeq-BLM for automatically 
representing and analyzing the sequence data. Experimental results show that the 
predictors generated by BioSeq-BLM achieve comparable or even obviously better 
performance than the exiting state-of-the-art predictors published in 
literatures, indicating that BioSeq-BLM will provide new approaches for 
biological sequence analysis based on natural language processing technologies, 
and contribute to the development of this very important field. In order to help 
the readers to use BioSeq-BLM for their own experiments, the corresponding web 
server and stand-alone package are established and released, which can be freely 
accessed at http://bliulab.net/BioSeq-BLM/.

Estimating the functional effect of single amino acid variants in proteins is 
fundamental for predicting the change in the thermodynamic stability, measured 
as the difference in the Gibbs free energy of unfolding, between the wild-type 
and the variant protein (ΔΔG). Here, we present the web-server of the DDGun 
method, which was previously developed for the ΔΔG prediction upon amino acid 
variants. DDGun is an untrained method based on basic features derived from 
evolutionary information. It is antisymmetric, as it predicts opposite ΔΔG 
values for direct (A → B) and reverse (B → A) single and multiple site variants. 
DDGun is available in two versions, one based on only sequence information and 
the other one based on sequence and structure information. Despite being 
untrained, DDGun reaches prediction performances comparable to those of trained 
methods. Here we make DDGun available as a web server. For the web server 
version, we updated the protein sequence database used for the computation of 
the evolutionary features, and we compiled two new data sets of protein variants 
to do a blind test of its performances. On these blind data sets of single and 
multiple site variants, DDGun confirms its prediction performance, reaching an 
average correlation coefficient between experimental and predicted ΔΔG of 0.45 
and 0.49 for the sequence-based and structure-based versions, respectively. 
Besides being used for the prediction of ΔΔG, we suggest that DDGun should be 
adopted as a benchmark method to assess the predictive capabilities of newly 
developed methods. Releasing DDGun as a web-server, stand-alone program and 
docker image will facilitate the necessary process of method comparison to 
improve ΔΔG prediction.

Plasmids are known to contain genes encoding for virulence factors and 
antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Their relevance in metagenomic data processing 
is steadily growing. However, with the increasing popularity and scale of 
metagenomics experiments, the number of reported plasmids is rapidly growing as 
well, amassing a considerable number of false positives due to undetected 
misassembles. Here, our previously published database PLSDB provides a reliable 
resource for researchers to quickly compare their sequences against selected and 
annotated previous findings. Within two years, the size of this resource has 
more than doubled from the initial 13,789 to now 34,513 entries over the course 
of eight regular data updates. For this update, we aggregated community feedback 
for major changes to the database featuring new analysis functionality as well 
as performance, quality, and accessibility improvements. New filtering steps, 
annotations, and preprocessing of existing records improve the quality of the 
provided data. Additionally, new features implemented in the web-server ease 
user interaction and allow for a deeper understanding of custom uploaded 
sequences, by visualizing similarity information. Lastly, an application 
programming interface was implemented along with a python library, to allow 
remote database queries in automated workflows. The latest release of PLSDB is 
freely accessible under https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/plsdb.

Carbohydrate Active EnZymes (CAZymes) are significantly important for microbial 
communities to thrive in carbohydrate rich environments such as animal guts, 
agricultural soils, forest floors, and ocean sediments. Since 2017, microbiome 
sequencing and assembly have produced numerous metagenome assembled genomes 
(MAGs). We have updated our dbCAN-seq database (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN_seq) 
to include the following new data and features: (i) ∼498 000 CAZymes and ∼169 
000 CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) from 9421 MAGs of four ecological (human gut, 
human oral, cow rumen, and marine) environments; (ii) Glycan substrates for 41 
447 (24.54%) CGCs inferred by two novel approaches (dbCAN-PUL homology search 
and eCAMI subfamily majority voting) (the two approaches agreed on 4183 CGCs for 
substrate assignments); (iii) A redesigned CGC page to include the graphical 
display of CGC gene compositions, the alignment of query CGC and subject PUL 
(polysaccharide utilization loci) of dbCAN-PUL, and the eCAMI subfamily table to 
support the predicted substrates; (iv) A statistics page to organize all the 
data for easy CGC access according to substrates and taxonomic phyla; and (v) A 
batch download page. In summary, this updated dbCAN-seq database highlights 
glycan substrates predicted for CGCs from microbiomes. Future work will 
implement the substrate prediction function in our dbCAN2 web server.

Correct identification and effective visualization of interactions in 
biomolecular structures facilitate understanding of their functions and 
molecular design. In response to the practical needs of structure-based 
analysis, we have created a Mapiya web server. The Mapiya integrates four main 
functionalities: (i) generation of contact maps - intramolecular and 
intermolecular-for proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes; (ii) 
characterization of the interactions physicochemical nature, (iii) interactive 
visualization of biomolecular conformations with automatic zoom on selected 
contacts using Molstar and (iv) additional sequence- and structure-based 
analyses performed with third-party software and in-house algorithms combined 
into an easy-to-use interface. Thus, Mapiya offers a highly customized analysis 
of the molecular interactions' in various biological systems. The web server is 
available at: http://mapiya.lcbio.pl/.

Proteins are essential macromolecules for the maintenance of living systems. 
Many of them perform their function by interacting with other molecules in 
regions called binding sites. The identification and characterization of these 
regions are of fundamental importance to determine protein function, being a 
fundamental step in processes such as drug design and discovery. However, 
identifying such binding regions is not trivial due to the drawbacks of 
experimental methods, which are costly and time-consuming. Here we propose 
GRaSP-web, a web server that uses GRaSP (Graph-based Residue neighborhood 
Strategy to Predict binding sites), a residue-centric method based on graphs 
that uses machine learning to predict putative ligand binding site residues. The 
method outperformed 6 state-of-the-art residue-centric methods (MCC of 0.61). 
Also, GRaSP-web is scalable as it takes 10-20 seconds to predict binding sites 
for a protein complex (the state-of-the-art residue-centric method takes 2-5h on 
the average). It proved to be consistent in predicting binding sites for 
bound/unbound structures (MCC 0.61 for both) and for a large dataset of 
multi-chain proteins (4500 entries, MCC 0.61). GRaSPWeb is freely available at 
https://grasp.ufv.br.

The active form of kinases is shared across different family members, as are 
several commonly observed inactive forms. We previously performed a clustering 
of the conformation of the activation loop of all protein kinase structures in 
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) into eight classes based on the dihedral angles that 
place the Phe side chain of the DFG motif at the N-terminus of the activation 
loop. Our clusters are strongly associated with the placement of the activation 
loop, the C-helix, and other structural elements of kinases. We present Kincore, 
a web resource providing access to our conformational assignments for kinase 
structures in the PDB. While other available databases provide conformational 
states or drug type but not both, KinCore includes the conformational state and 
the inhibitor type (Type 1, 1.5, 2, 3, allosteric) for each kinase chain. The 
user can query and browse the database using these attributes or determine the 
conformational labels of a kinase structure using the web server or a standalone 
program. The database and labeled structure files can be downloaded from the 
server. Kincore will help in understanding the conformational dynamics of these 
proteins and guide development of inhibitors targeting specific states. Kincore 
is available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/kincore.

Molecular dynamics simulation is a proven technique for computing and 
visualizing the time-resolved motion of macromolecules at atomic resolution. The 
MDsrv is a tool that streams MD trajectories and displays them interactively in 
web browsers without requiring advanced skills, facilitating interactive 
exploration and collaborative visual analysis. We have now enhanced the MDsrv to 
further simplify the upload and sharing of MD trajectories and improve their 
online viewing and analysis. With the new instance, the MDsrv simplifies the 
creation of sessions, which allows the exchange of MD trajectories with preset 
representations and perspectives. An important innovation is that the MDsrv can 
now access and visualize trajectories from remote datasets, which greatly 
expands its applicability and use, as the data no longer needs to be accessible 
on a local server. In addition, initial analyses such as sequence or structure 
alignments, distance measurements, or RMSD calculations have been implemented, 
which optionally support visual analysis. Finally, based on Mol*, MDsrv now 
provides faster and more efficient visualization of even large trajectories 
compared to its predecessor tool NGL.

The transplantation of loops between structurally related proteins is a 
compelling method to improve the activity, specificity and stability of enzymes. 
However, despite the interest of loop regions in protein engineering, the 
available methods of loop-based rational protein design are scarce. One 
particular difficulty related to loop engineering is the unique dynamism that 
enables them to exert allosteric control over the catalytic function of enzymes. 
Thus, when engaging in a transplantation effort, such dynamics in the context of 
protein structure need consideration. A second practical challenge is 
identifying successful excision points for the transplantation or grafting. 
Here, we present LoopGrafter (https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/loopgrafter/), a 
web server that specifically guides in the loop grafting process between 
structurally related proteins. The server provides a step-by-step interactive 
procedure in which the user can successively identify loops in the two input 
proteins, calculate their geometries, assess their similarities and dynamics, 
and select a number of loops to be transplanted. All possible different chimeric 
proteins derived from any existing recombination point are calculated, and 3D 
models for each of them are constructed and energetically evaluated. The 
obtained results can be interactively visualized in a user-friendly graphical 
interface and downloaded for detailed structural analyses.

Genomicus is a database and web-server dedicated to comparative genomics in 
eukaryotes. Its main functionality is to graphically represent the conservation 
of genomic blocks between multiple genomes, locally around a specific gene of 
interest or genome-wide through karyotype comparisons. Since 2010 and its first 
release, Genomicus has synchronized with 60 Ensembl releases and seen the 
addition of functions that have expanded the type of analyses that users can 
perform. Today, five public instances of Genomicus are supporting a total number 
of 1029 extant genomes and 621 ancestral reconstructions from all eukaryotes 
kingdoms available in Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes databases complemented with 
four additional instances specific to taxonomic groups of interest. New 
visualization and query tools are described in this manuscript. Genomicus is 
freely available at http://www.genomicus.bio.ens.psl.eu/genomicus.

Knowledge of protein-ligand binding sites (LBSs) enables research ranging from 
protein function annotation to structure-based drug design. To this end, we have 
previously developed a stand-alone tool, P2Rank, and the web server PrankWeb 
(https://prankweb.cz/) for fast and accurate LBS prediction. Here, we present 
significant enhancements to PrankWeb. First, a new, more accurate evolutionary 
conservation estimation pipeline based on the UniRef50 sequence database and the 
HMMER3 package is introduced. Second, PrankWeb now allows users to enter UniProt 
ID to carry out LBS predictions in situations where no experimental structure is 
available by utilizing the AlphaFold model database. Additionally, a range of 
minor improvements has been implemented. These include the ability to deploy 
PrankWeb and P2Rank as Docker containers, support for the mmCIF file format, 
improved public REST API access, or the ability to batch download the LBS 
predictions for the whole PDB archive and parts of the AlphaFold database.

We present ANANASTRA, https://ananastra.autosome.org, a web server for the 
identification and annotation of regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) with allele-specific binding events. ANANASTRA accepts a list of dbSNP 
IDs or a VCF file and reports allele-specific binding (ASB) sites of particular 
transcription factors or in specific cell types, highlighting those with ASBs 
significantly enriched at SNPs in the query list. ANANASTRA is built on top of a 
systematic analysis of allelic imbalance in ChIP-Seq experiments and performs 
the ASB enrichment test against background sets of SNPs found in the same source 
experiments as ASB sites but not displaying significant allelic imbalance. We 
illustrate ANANASTRA usage with selected case studies and expect that ANANASTRA 
will help to conduct the follow-up of GWAS in terms of establishing functional 
hypotheses and designing experimental verification.

Significant improvements have been made in the efficiency and accuracy of RNA 3D 
structure prediction methods in recent years; however, many tools developed in 
the field stay exclusive to only a few bioinformatic groups. To perform a 
complete RNA 3D structure modeling analysis as proposed by the RNA-Puzzles 
community, researchers must familiarize themselves with a quite complex set of 
tools. In order to facilitate the processing of RNA sequences and structures, we 
previously developed the rna-tools package. However, using rna-tools requires 
the installation of a mixture of libraries and tools, basic knowledge of the 
command line and the Python programming language. To provide an opportunity for 
the broader community of biologists to take advantage of the new developments in 
RNA structural biology, we developed rna-tools.online. The web server provides a 
user-friendly platform to perform many standard analyses required for the 
typical modeling workflow: 3D structure manipulation and editing, structure 
minimization, structure analysis, quality assessment, and comparison. 
rna-tools.online supports biologists to start benefiting from the maturing field 
of RNA 3D structural bioinformatics and can be used for educational purposes. 
The web server is available at https://rna-tools.online.

Olfaction is a multi-stage process that initiates with the odorants entering the 
nose and terminates with the brain recognizing the odor associated with the 
odorant. In a very intricate way, the process incorporates various components 
functioning together and in synchronization. OlfactionBase is a free, 
open-access web server that aims to bring together knowledge about many aspects 
of the olfaction mechanism in one place. OlfactionBase contains detailed 
information of components like odors, odorants, and odorless compounds with 
physicochemical and ADMET properties, olfactory receptors (ORs), odorant- and 
pheromone binding proteins, OR-odorant interactions in Human and Mus musculus. 
The dynamic, user-friendly interface of the resource facilitates exploration of 
different entities: finding chemical compounds having desired odor, finding 
odorants associated with OR, associating chemical features with odor and OR, 
finding sequence information of ORs and related proteins. Finally, the data in 
OlfactionBase on odors, odorants, olfactory receptors, human and mouse 
OR-odorant pairs, and other associated proteins could aid in the inference and 
improved understanding of odor perception, which might provide new insights into 
the mechanism underlying olfaction. The OlfactionBase is available at 
https://bioserver.iiita.ac.in/olfactionbase/.

Protein-ligand blind docking is a powerful method for exploring the binding 
sites of receptors and the corresponding binding poses of ligands. It has seen 
wide applications in pharmaceutical and biological researches. Previously, we 
proposed a blind docking server, CB-Dock, which has been under heavy use (over 
200 submissions per day) by researchers worldwide since 2019. Here, we 
substantially improved the docking method by combining CB-Dock with our 
template-based docking engine to enhance the accuracy in binding site 
identification and binding pose prediction. In the benchmark tests, it yielded 
the success rate of ∼85% for binding pose prediction (RMSD < 2.0 Å), which 
outperformed original CB-Dock and most popular blind docking tools. This updated 
docking server, named CB-Dock2, reconfigured the input and output web 
interfaces, together with a highly automatic docking pipeline, making it a 
particularly efficient and easy-to-use tool for the bioinformatics and 
cheminformatics communities. The web server is freely available at 
https://cadd.labshare.cn/cb-dock2/.

Residue interaction networks (RINs) are used to represent residue contacts in 
protein structures. Thanks to the advances in network theory, RINs have been 
proved effective as an alternative to coordinate data in the analysis of complex 
systems. The RING server calculates high quality and reliable non-covalent 
molecular interactions based on geometrical parameters. Here, we present the new 
RING 3.0 version extending the previous functionality in several ways. The 
underlying software library has been re-engineered to improve speed by an order 
of magnitude. RING now also supports the mmCIF format and provides typed 
interactions for the entire PDB chemical component dictionary, including nucleic 
acids. Moreover, RING now employs probabilistic graphs, where multiple 
conformations (e.g. NMR or molecular dynamics ensembles) are mapped as weighted 
edges, opening up new ways to analyze structural data. The web interface has 
been expanded to include a simultaneous view of the RIN alongside a structure 
viewer, with both synchronized and clickable. Contact evolution across models 
(or time) is displayed as a heatmap and can help in the discovery of correlating 
interaction patterns. The web server, together with an extensive help and 
tutorial, is available from URL: https://ring.biocomputingup.it/.

For many RNA molecules, the secondary structure is essential for the correct 
function of the RNA. Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide 
sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance 
has reached a plateau over time. Traditional RNA secondary structure prediction 
algorithms are primarily based on thermodynamic models through free energy 
minimization, which imposes strong prior assumptions and is slow to run. Here, 
we propose a deep learning-based method, called UFold, for RNA secondary 
structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data and base-pairing rules. 
UFold proposes a novel image-like representation of RNA sequences, which can be 
efficiently processed by Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). We benchmark the 
performance of UFold on both within- and cross-family RNA datasets. It 
significantly outperforms previous methods on within-family datasets, while 
achieving a similar performance as the traditional methods when trained and 
tested on distinct RNA families. UFold is also able to predict pseudoknots 
accurately. Its prediction is fast with an inference time of about 160 ms per 
sequence up to 1500 bp in length. An online web server running UFold is 
available at https://ufold.ics.uci.edu. Code is available at 
https://github.com/uci-cbcl/UFold.

Proteins with similar phylogenetic patterns of conservation or loss across 
evolutionary taxa are strong candidates to work in the same cellular pathways or 
engage in physical or functional interactions. Our previously published tools 
implemented our method of normalized phylogenetic sequence profiling to detect 
functional associations between non-homologous proteins. However, many proteins 
consist of multiple protein domains subjected to different selective pressures, 
so using protein domain as the unit of analysis improves the detection of 
similar phylogenetic patterns. Here we analyze sequence conservation patterns 
across the whole tree of life for every protein domain from a set of widely 
studied organisms. The resulting new interactive webserver, DEPCOD (DEtection of 
Phylogenetically COrrelated Domains), performs searches with either a selected 
pre-defined protein domain or a user-supplied sequence as a query to detect 
other domains from the same organism that have similar conservation patterns. 
Top similarities on two evolutionary scales (the whole tree of life or

The development of transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has enabled 
researchers to better identify and interpret causal genes in many diseases. 
However, there are currently no resources providing a comprehensive listing of 
gene-disease associations discovered by TWAS from published GWAS summary 
statistics. TWAS analyses are also difficult to conduct due to the complexity of 
TWAS software pipelines. To address these issues, we introduce a new resource 
called webTWAS, which integrates a database of the most comprehensive disease 
GWAS datasets currently available with credible sets of potential causal genes 
identified by multiple TWAS software packages. Specifically, a total of 235 064 
gene-diseases associations for a wide range of human diseases are prioritized 
from 1298 high-quality downloadable European GWAS summary statistics. 
Associations are calculated with seven different statistical models based on 
three popular and representative TWAS software packages. Users can explore 
associations at the gene or disease level, and easily search for related studies 
or diseases using the MeSH disease tree. Since the effects of diseases are 
highly tissue-specific, webTWAS applies tissue-specific enrichment analysis to 
identify significant tissues. A user-friendly web server is also available to 
run custom TWAS analyses on user-provided GWAS summary statistics data. webTWAS 
is freely available at http://www.webtwas.net.

PaintOmics is a web server for the integrative analysis and visualisation of 
multi-omics datasets using biological pathway maps. PaintOmics 4 has several 
notable updates that improve and extend analyses. Three pathway databases are 
now supported: KEGG, Reactome and MapMan, providing more comprehensive pathway 
knowledge for animals and plants. New metabolite analysis methods fill gaps in 
traditional pathway-based enrichment methods. The metabolite hub analysis 
selects compounds with a high number of significant genes in their neighbouring 
network, suggesting regulation by gene expression changes. The metabolite class 
activity analysis tests the hypothesis that a metabolic class has a 
higher-than-expected proportion of significant elements, indicating that these 
compounds are regulated in the experiment. Finally, PaintOmics 4 includes a 
regulatory omics module to analyse the contribution of trans-regulatory layers 
(microRNA and transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins) to regulate pathways. 
We show the performance of PaintOmics 4 on both mouse and plant data to 
highlight how these new analysis features provide novel insights into regulatory 
biology. PaintOmics 4 is available at https://paintomics.org/.

Recent advances in protein structural modelling have enabled the accurate 
prediction of the holo 3D structures of almost any protein, however protein 
function is intrinsically linked to the interactions it makes. While a number of 
computational approaches have been proposed to explore potential biological 
interactions, they have been limited to specific interactions, and have not been 
readily accessible for non-experts or use in bioinformatics pipelines. Here we 
present CSM-Potential, a geometric deep learning approach to identify regions of 
a protein surface that are likely to mediate protein-protein and protein-ligand 
interactions in order to provide a link between 3D structure and biological 
function. Our method has shown robust performance, outperforming existing 
methods for both predictive tasks. By assessing the performance of CSM-Potential 
on independent blind tests, we show that our method was able to achieve ROC AUC 
values of up to 0.81 for the identification of potential protein-protein binding 
sites, and up to 0.96 accuracy on biological ligand classification. Our method 
is freely available as a user-friendly and easy-to-use web server and API at 
http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/csm_potential.

Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing have made it 
possible to profoundly advance our ability to accurately predict protein 
structures and their functions. While such improvements are significantly 
impacting the fields of biology and biotechnology at large, such methods have 
the downside of high demands in terms of computing power and runtime, hampering 
their applicability to large datasets. Here, we present NetSurfP-3.0, a tool for 
predicting solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder and 
backbone dihedral angles for each residue of an amino acid sequence. This 
NetSurfP update exploits recent advances in pre-trained protein language models 
to drastically improve the runtime of its predecessor by two orders of 
magnitude, while displaying similar prediction performance. We assessed the 
accuracy of NetSurfP-3.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to 
consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output 
features, with a runtime that is up to to 600 times faster than the most 
commonly available methods performing the same tasks. The tool is freely 
available as a web server with a user-friendly interface to navigate the 
results, as well as a standalone downloadable package.

For decades, natural products have been used as a primary resource in drug 
discovery pipelines to find new antibiotics, which are mainly produced as 
secondary metabolites by bacteria. The biosynthesis of these compounds is 
encoded in co-localized genes termed biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, 
BGCs are often not expressed under laboratory conditions. Several genetic 
manipulation strategies have been developed in order to activate or overexpress 
silent BGCs. Significant increases in production levels of secondary metabolites 
were indeed achieved by modifying the expression of genes encoding regulators 
and transporters, as well as genes involved in resistance or precursor 
biosynthesis. However, the abundance of genes encoding such functions within 
bacterial genomes requires prioritization of the most promising ones for genetic 
manipulation strategies. Here, we introduce the 'Secondary Metabolite 
Transcriptomic Pipeline' (SeMa-Trap), a user-friendly web-server, available at 
https://sema-trap.ziemertlab.com. SeMa-Trap facilitates RNA-Seq based 
transcriptome analyses, finds co-expression patterns between certain genes and 
BGCs of interest, and helps optimize the design of comparative transcriptomic 
analyses. Finally, SeMa-Trap provides interactive result pages for each BGC, 
allowing the easy exploration and comparison of expression patterns. In summary, 
SeMa-Trap allows a straightforward prioritization of genes that could be 
targeted via genetic engineering approaches to (over)express BGCs of interest.
