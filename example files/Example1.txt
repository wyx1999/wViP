Here we present an update to MutationTaster, our DNA variant effect prediction 
tool. The new version uses a different prediction model and attains higher 
accuracy than its predecessor, especially for rare benign variants. In addition, 
we have integrated many sources of data that only became available after the 
last release (such as gnomAD and ExAC pLI scores) and changed the splice site 
prediction model. To more easily assess the relevance of detected known disease 
mutations to the clinical phenotype of the patient, MutationTaster now provides 
information on the diseases they cause. Further changes represent a major 
overhaul of the interfaces to increase user-friendliness whilst many changes 
under the hood have been designed to accelerate the processing of uploaded VCF 
files. We also offer an API for the rapid automated query of smaller numbers of 
variants from within other software. MutationTaster2021 integrates our disease 
mutation search engine, MutationDistiller, to prioritise variants from VCF files 
using the patient's clinical phenotype. The novel version is available at 
https://www.genecascade.org/MutationTaster2021/. This website is free and open 
to all users and there is no login requirement.

In clinical genetics, the Human Phenotype Ontology as well as disease ontologies 
are often used for deep phenotyping of patients and coding of clinical 
diagnoses. However, assigning ontology classes to patient descriptions is often 
disconnected from writing patient reports or manuscripts in word processing 
software. This additional workload and the requirement to install dedicated 
software may discourage usage of ontologies for parts of the target audience. 
Here we present Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate 
patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or 
manuscripts. We adopt Zotero, a citation management software to create a tool 
which allows to reference classes from ontologies within text at the time of 
writing. We expect this approach to decrease the additional workload to a 
minimum while ensuring high quality associations with ontology classes. 
Standardized collection of phenotypic information at the time of describing the 
patient allows for streamlining the clinic workflow and efficient data entry. It 
will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis with the ultimate 
goal of better understanding genetic diseases. Thus, we believe that Phenotero 
eases the usage of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in the field of 
clinical genetics.

With the shift from SNP arrays to high-throughput sequencing, most researchers 
studying diseases in consanguineous families do not rely on linkage analysis any 
longer, but simply search for deleterious variants which are homozygous in all 
patients. AutozygosityMapper allows the fast and convenient identification of 
disease mutations in patients from consanguineous pedigrees by focussing on 
homozygous segments shared by all patients. Users can upload multi-sample VCF 
files, including WGS data, without any pre-processing. Genome-wide runs of 
homozygosity and the underlying genotypes are presented in graphical interfaces. 
AutozygosityMapper extends the functions of its predecessor, HomozygosityMapper, 
to the search for autozygous regions, in which all patients share the same 
homozygous genotype. We provide export of VCF files containing only the variants 
found in homozygous regions, this usually reduces the number of variants by two 
orders of magnitude. These regions can also directly be analysed with our 
disease mutation identification tool MutationDistiller. The application comes 
with simple and intuitive graphical interfaces for data upload, analysis, and 
results. We kept the structure of HomozygosityMapper so that previous users will 
find it easy to switch. With AutozygosityMapper, we provide a fast web-based way 
to identify disease mutations in consanguineous families. AutozygosityMapper is 
freely available at https://www.genecascade.org/AutozygosityMapper/.

The temporal and spatial expression of genes is controlled by promoters and 
enhancers. Findings obtained over the last decade that not only promoters but 
also enhancers are characterized by bidirectional, divergent transcription have 
challenged the traditional notion that promoters and enhancers represent 
distinct classes of regulatory elements. Over half of human promoters are 
associated with CpG islands (CGIs), relatively CpG-rich stretches of generally 
several hundred nucleotides that are often associated with housekeeping genes. 
Only about 6% of transcribed enhancers defined by CAGE-tag analysis are 
associated with CGIs. Here, we present an analysis of enhancer and promoter 
characteristics and relate them to the presence or absence of CGIs. We show that 
transcribed enhancers share a number of CGI-dependent characteristics with 
promoters, including statistically significant local overrepresentation of core 
promoter elements. CGI-associated enhancers are longer, display higher 
directionality of transcription, greater expression, a lesser degree of tissue 
specificity, and a higher frequency of transcription-factor binding events than 
non-CGI-associated enhancers. Genes putatively regulated by CGI-associated 
enhancers are enriched for transcription regulator activity. Our findings show 
that CGI-associated transcribed enhancers display a series of characteristics 
related to sequence, expression and function that distinguish them from 
enhancers not associated with CGIs.

MutationDistiller is a freely available online tool for user-driven analyses of 
Whole Exome Sequencing data. It offers a user-friendly interface aimed at 
clinicians and researchers, who are not necessarily bioinformaticians. 
MutationDistiller combines MutationTaster's pathogenicity predictions with a 
phenotype-based approach. Phenotypic information is not limited to symptoms 
included in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), but may also comprise clinical 
diagnoses and the suspected mode of inheritance. The search can be restricted to 
lists of candidate genes (e.g. virtual gene panels) and by tissue-specific gene 
expression. The inclusion of GeneOntology (GO) and metabolic pathways 
facilitates the discovery of hitherto unknown disease genes. In a novel 
approach, we trained MutationDistiller's HPO-based prioritization on authentic 
genotype-phenotype sets obtained from ClinVar and found it to match or 
outcompete current prioritization tools in terms of accuracy. In the output, the 
program provides a list of potential disease mutations ordered by the likelihood 
of the affected genes to cause the phenotype. MutationDistiller provides links 
to gene-related information from various resources. It has been extensively 
tested by clinicians and their suggestions have been valued in many iterative 
cycles of revisions. The tool, a comprehensive documentation and examples are 
freely available at https://www.mutationdistiller.org/.

HIPBI-RD (Harmonising phenomics information for a better interoperability in the 
rare disease field) is a three-year project which started in 2016 funded via the 
E-Rare 3 ERA-NET program. This project builds on three resources largely adopted 
by the rare disease (RD) community: Orphanet, its ontology ORDO (the Orphanet 
Rare Disease Ontology), HPO (the Human Phenotype Ontology) as well as PhenoTips 
software for the capture and sharing of structured phenotypic data for RD 
patients. Our project is further supported by resources developed by the 
European Bioinformatics Institute and the Garvan Institute. HIPBI-RD aims to 
provide the community with an integrated, RD-specific bioinformatics ecosystem 
that will harmonise the way phenomics information is stored in databases and 
patient files worldwide, and thereby contribute to interoperability. This 
ecosystem will consist of a suite of tools and ontologies, optimized to work 
together, and made available through commonly used software repositories. The 
project workplan follows three main objectives: The HIPBI-RD ecosystem will 
contribute to the interpretation of variants identified through exome and full 
genome sequencing by harmonising the way phenotypic information is collected, 
thus improving diagnostics and delineation of RD. The ultimate goal of HIPBI-RD 
is to provide a resource that will contribute to bridging genome-scale biology 
and a disease-centered view on human pathobiology. Achievements in Year 1.

With Aviator, we present a web service and repository that facilitates 
surveillance of online tools. Aviator consists of a user-friendly website and 
two modules, a literature-mining based general and a manually curated module. 
The general module currently checks 9417 websites twice a day with respect to 
their availability and stores many features (frontend and backend response time, 
required RAM and size of the web page, security certificates, analytic tools and 
trackers embedded in the webpage and others) in a data warehouse. Aviator is 
also equipped with an analysis functionality, for example authors can check and 
evaluate the availability of their own tools or those of their peers. Likewise, 
users can check the availability of a certain tool they intend to use in 
research or teaching to avoid including unstable tools. The curated section of 
Aviator offers additional services. We provide API snippets for common 
programming languages (Perl, PHP, Python, JavaScript) as well as an OpenAPI 
documentation for embedding in the backend of own web services for an automatic 
test of their function. We query the respective APIs twice a day and send 
automated notifications in case of an unexpected result. Naturally, the same 
analysis functionality as for the literature-based module is available for the 
curated section. Aviator can freely be used at 
https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/aviator.

Precision medicine needs precise phenotypes. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) 
uses clinical signs instead of diagnoses and has become the standard annotation 
for patients' phenotypes when describing single gene disorders. Use of the HPO 
beyond human genetics is however still limited. With SAMS (Symptom Annotation 
Made Simple), we want to bring sign-based phenotyping to routine clinical care, 
to hospital patients as well as to outpatients. Our web-based application 
provides access to three widely used annotation systems: HPO, OMIM, Orphanet. 
Whilst data can be stored in our database, phenotypes can also be imported and 
exported as Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Phenopackets without 
using the database. The web interface can easily be integrated into local 
databases, e.g. clinical information systems. SAMS offers users to share their 
data with others, empowering patients to record their own signs and symptoms (or 
those of their children) and thus provide their doctors with additional 
information. We think that our approach will lead to better characterised 
patients which is not only helpful for finding disease mutations but also to 
better understand the pathophysiology of diseases and to recruit patients for 
studies and clinical trials. SAMS is freely available at 
https://www.genecascade.org/SAMS/.

VarFish is a user-friendly web application for the quality control, filtering, 
prioritization, analysis, and user-based annotation of DNA variant data with a 
focus on rare disease genetics. It is capable of processing variant call files 
with single or multiple samples. The variants are automatically annotated with 
population frequencies, molecular impact, and presence in databases such as 
ClinVar. Further, it provides support for pathogenicity scores including CADD, 
MutationTaster, and phenotypic similarity scores. Users can filter variants 
based on these annotations and presumed inheritance pattern and sort the results 
by these scores. Variants passing the filter are listed with their annotations 
and many useful link-outs to genome browsers, other gene/variant data portals, 
and external tools for variant assessment. VarFish allows users to create their 
own annotations including support for variant assessment following ACMG-AMP 
guidelines. In close collaboration with medical practitioners, VarFish was 
designed for variant analysis and prioritization in diagnostic and research 
settings as described in the software's extensive manual. The user interface has 
been optimized for supporting these protocols. Users can install VarFish on 
their own in-house servers where it provides additional lab notebook features 
for collaborative analysis and allows re-analysis of cases, e.g. after update of 
genotype or phenotype databases.

RegulationSpotter is a web-based tool for the user-friendly annotation and 
interpretation of DNA variants located outside of protein-coding transcripts 
(extratranscriptic variants). It is designed for clinicians and researchers who 
wish to assess the potential impact of the considerable number of non-coding 
variants found in Whole Genome Sequencing runs. It annotates individual variants 
with underlying regulatory features in an intuitive way by assessing over 100 
genome-wide annotations. Additionally, it calculates a score, which reflects the 
regulatory potential of the variant region. Its dichotomous classifications, 
'functional' or 'non-functional', and a human-readable presentation of the 
underlying evidence allow a biologically meaningful interpretation of the score. 
The output shows key aspects of every variant and allows rapid access to more 
detailed information about its possible role in gene regulation. 
RegulationSpotter can either analyse single variants or complete VCF files. 
Variants located within protein-coding transcripts are automatically assessed by 
MutationTaster as well as by RegulationSpotter to account for possible 
intragenic regulatory effects. RegulationSpotter offers the possibility of using 
phenotypic data to focus on known disease genes or genomic elements interacting 
with them. RegulationSpotter is freely available at 
https://www.regulationspotter.org.

High-throughput technologies led to the generation of a wealth of data on 
regulatory DNA elements in the human genome. However, results from 
disease-driven studies are primarily shared in textual form as scientific 
articles. Information extraction (IE) algorithms allow this information to be 
(semi-)automatically accessed. Their development, however, is dependent on the 
availability of annotated corpora. Therefore, we introduce RegEl (Regulatory 
Elements), the first freely available corpus annotated with regulatory DNA 
elements comprising 305 PubMed abstracts for a total of 2690 sentences. We focus 
on enhancers, promoters and transcription factor binding sites. Three annotators 
worked in two stages, achieving an overall 0.73 F1 inter-annotator agreement and 
0.46 for regulatory elements. Depending on the entity type, IE baselines reach 
F1-scores of 0.48-0.91 for entity detection and 0.71-0.88 for entity 
normalization. Next, we apply our entity detection models to the entire PubMed 
collection and extract co-occurrences of genes or diseases with regulatory 
elements. This generates large collections of regulatory elements associated 
with 137 870 unique genes and 7420 diseases, which we make openly available.

Genome-wide association studies use hundreds of thousands of markers making it 
challenging to present and finally interpret the results. We developed a 
graphical, web-based solution for an interactive exploration of the results of 
case-control studies, with a tight integration of related gene information and 
tissue-specific expression data. Association results are presented as physical 
position-based vertical bars with known genes included as horizontal bars at 
their respective physical positions. The interface allows the specification of 
filtering criteria for the association data and highlights potentially 
interesting genes with user-specified terms occurring in their reports or with 
relevant expression patterns. Pop-up windows and hyperlinks provide drill-down 
capabilities and quick access to relevant data AssociationDB can either be used 
as a stand-alone solution or as a front-end joining association results obtained 
by other software with genomic information.

We aimed to evaluate SIGLEC1 (CD169) as a biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS) 
and Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and to evaluate the presence 
of SIGLEC1+ myeloid cells in demyelinating diseases. We performed flow 
cytometry-based measurements of SIGLEC1 expression on monocytes in 86 MS 
patients, 41 NMOSD patients and 31 healthy controls. Additionally, we 
histologically evaluated the presence of SIGLEC1+ myeloid cells in acute and 
chronic MS brain lesions as well as other neurological diseases. We found 
elevated SIGLEC1 expression in 16/86 (18.6%) MS patients and 4/41 (9.8%) NMOSD 
patients. Almost all MS patients with high SIGLEC1 levels received exogenous 
interferon beta as an immunomodulatory treatment and only a small fraction of MS 
patients without interferon treatment had increased SIGLEC1 expression. In our 
cohort, SIGLEC1 expression on monocytes was-apart from those patients receiving 
interferon treatment-not significantly increased in patients with MS and NMOSD, 
nor were levels associated with more severe disease. SIGLEC1+ myeloid cells were 
abundantly present in active MS lesions as well as in a range of acute 
infectious and malignant diseases of the central nervous system, but not chronic 
MS lesions. The presence of SIGLEC1+ myeloid cells in brain lesions could be 
used to investigate the activity in an inflammatory CNS lesion.

HomozygosityMapper--an interactive approach to homozygosity mapping.

Homozygosity mapping is a common method for mapping recessive traits in 
consanguineous families. In most studies, applications for multipoint linkage 
analyses are applied to determine the genomic region linked to the disease. 
Unfortunately, these are neither suited for very large families nor for the 
inclusion of tens of thousands of SNPs. Even if less than 10,000 markers are 
employed, such an analysis may easily last hours if not days. Here we present a 
web-based approach to homozygosity mapping. Our application stores marker data 
in a database into which users can directly upload their own SNP genotype files. 
Within a few minutes, the database analyses the data, detects homozygous 
stretches and provides an intuitive graphical interface to the results. The 
homozygosity in affected individuals is visualized genome-wide with the ability 
to zoom into single chromosomes and user-defined chromosomal regions. The 
software also displays the underlying genotypes in all samples. It is integrated 
with our candidate gene search engine, GeneDistiller, so that users can 
interactively determine the most promising gene. They can at any point restrict 
access to their data or make it public, allowing HomozygosityMapper to be used 
as a data repository for homozygosity-mapping studies. HomozygosityMapper is 
available at http://www.homozygositymapper.org/.

GeneDistiller--distilling candidate genes from linkage intervals.

Germany.

BACKGROUND: Linkage studies often yield intervals containing several hundred 
positional candidate genes. Different manual or automatic approaches exist for 
the determination of the gene most likely to cause the disease. While the manual 
search is very flexible and takes advantage of the researchers' background 
knowledge and intuition, it may be very cumbersome to collect and study the 
relevant data. Automatic solutions on the other hand usually focus on certain 
models, remain "black boxes" and do not offer the same degree of flexibility.
METHODOLOGY: We have developed a web-based application that combines the 
advantages of both approaches. Information from various data sources such as 
gene-phenotype associations, gene expression patterns and protein-protein 
interactions was integrated into a central database. Researchers can select 
which information for the genes within a candidate interval or for single genes 
shall be displayed. Genes can also interactively be filtered, sorted and 
prioritised according to criteria derived from the background knowledge and 
preconception of the disease under scrutiny.
CONCLUSIONS: GeneDistiller provides knowledge-driven, fully interactive and 
intuitive access to multiple data sources. It displays maximum relevant 
information, while saving the user from drowning in the flood of data. A typical 
query takes less than two seconds, thus allowing an interactive and explorative 
approach to the hunt for the candidate gene.
ACCESS: GeneDistiller can be freely accessed at http://www.genedistiller.org.

While great advances in predicting the effects of coding variants have been 
made, the assessment of non-coding variants remains challenging. This is 
especially problematic for variants within promoter regions which can lead to 
over-expression of a gene or reduce or even abolish its expression. The binding 
of transcription factors to the DNA can be predicted using position weight 
matrices (PWMs). More recently, transcription factor flexible models (TFFMs) 
have been introduced and shown to be more accurate than PWMs. TFFMs are based on 
hidden Markov models and can account for complex positional dependencies. Our 
new web-based application FABIAN-variant uses 1224 TFFMs and 3790 PWMs to 
predict whether and to which degree DNA variants affect the binding of 1387 
different human transcription factors. For each variant and transcription 
factor, the software combines the results of different models for a final 
prediction of the resulting binding-affinity change. The software is written in 
C++ for speed but variants can be entered through a web interface. 
Alternatively, a VCF file can be uploaded to assess variants identified by 
high-throughput sequencing. The search can be restricted to variants in the 
vicinity of candidate genes. FABIAN-variant is available freely at 
https://www.genecascade.org/fabian/.

Homozygosity mapping is a common method to map recessive traits in 
consanguineous families. To facilitate these analyses, we have developed 
HomozygosityMapper, a web-based approach to homozygosity mapping. 
HomozygosityMapper allows researchers to directly upload the genotype files 
produced by the major genotyping platforms as well as deep sequencing data. It 
detects stretches of homozygosity shared by the affected individuals and 
displays them graphically. Users can interactively inspect the underlying 
genotypes, manually refine these regions and eventually submit them to our 
candidate gene search engine GeneDistiller to identify the most promising 
candidate genes. Here, we present the new version of HomozygosityMapper. The 
most striking new feature is the support of Next Generation Sequencing *.vcf 
files as input. Upon users' requests, we have implemented the analysis of common 
experimental rodents as well as of important farm animals. Furthermore, we have 
extended the options for single families and loss of heterozygosity studies. 
Another new feature is the export of *.bed files for targeted enrichment of the 
potential disease regions for deep sequencing strategies. HomozygosityMapper 
also generates files for conventional linkage analyses which are already 
restricted to the possible disease regions, hence superseding CPU-intensive 
genome-wide analyses. HomozygosityMapper is freely available at 
http://www.homozygositymapper.org/.

Erratum in
    BMC Genomics. 2016 Jul 20;17(1):502.

BACKGROUND: The modelling of gene regulation is a major challenge in biomedical 
research. This process is dominated by transcription factors (TFs) and mutations 
in their binding sites (TFBSs) may cause the misregulation of genes, eventually 
leading to disease. The consequences of DNA variants on TF binding are modelled 
in silico using binding matrices, but it remains unclear whether these are 
capable of accurately representing in vivo binding. In this study, we present a 
systematic comparison of binding models for 82 human TFs from three freely 
available sources: JASPAR matrices, HT-SELEX-generated models and matrices 
derived from protein binding microarrays (PBMs). We determined their ability to 
detect experimentally verified "real" in vivo TFBSs derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq 
data. As negative controls we chose random downstream exonic sequences, which 
are unlikely to harbour TFBS. All models were assessed by receiver operating 
characteristics (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: While the area-under-curve was low for most of the tested models with 
only 47 % reaching a score of 0.7 or higher, we noticed strong differences 
between the various position-specific scoring matrices with JASPAR and HT-SELEX 
models showing higher success rates than PBM-derived models. In addition, we 
found that while TFBS sequences showed a higher degree of conservation than 
randomly chosen sequences, there was a high variability between individual 
TFBSs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that only few of the matrix-based models used to 
predict potential TFBS are able to reliably detect experimentally confirmed 
TFBS. We compiled our findings in a freely accessible web application called 
ePOSSUM ( http:/mutationtaster.charite.de/ePOSSUM/ ) which uses a Bayes 
classifier to assess the impact of genetic alterations on TF binding in 
user-defined sequences. Additionally, ePOSSUM provides information on the 
reliability of the prediction using our test set of experimentally confirmed 
binding sites.

BACKGROUND: Genes implicated in the Golgi and endosomal trafficking machinery 
are crucial for brain development, and mutations in them are particularly 
associated with postnatal microcephaly (POM).
METHODS: Exome sequencing was performed in three affected individuals from two 
unrelated consanguineous families presenting with delayed neurodevelopment, 
intellectual disability of variable degree, POM and failure to thrive. 
Patient-derived fibroblasts were tested for functional effects of the variants.
RESULTS: We detected homozygous truncating variants in ATP9A. While the variant 
in family A is predicted to result in an early premature termination codon, the 
variant in family B affects a canonical splice site. Both variants lead to a 
substantial reduction of ATP9A mRNA expression. It has been shown previously 
that ATP9A localises to early and recycling endosomes, whereas its depletion 
leads to altered gene expression of components from this compartment. Consistent 
with previous findings, we also observed overexpression of ARPC3 and SNX3, genes 
strongly interacting with ATP9A.
CONCLUSION: In aggregate, our findings show that pathogenic variants in ATP9A 
cause a novel autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with POM. While 
the physiological function of endogenous ATP9A is still largely elusive, our 
results underline a crucial role of this gene in endosomal transport in brain 
tissue.

BACKGROUND: Many genetic studies and functional assays are based on cDNA 
fragments. After the generation of cDNA fragments from an mRNA sample, their 
content is at first unknown and must be assigned by sequencing reactions or 
hybridisation experiments. Even in characterised libraries, a considerable 
number of clones are wrongly annotated. Furthermore, mix-ups can happen in the 
laboratory. It is therefore essential to the relevance of experimental results 
to confirm or determine the identity of the employed cDNA fragments. However, 
the manual approach for the characterisation of these fragments using BLAST web 
interfaces is not suited for larger number of sequences and so far, no 
user-friendly software is publicly available.
RESULTS: Here we present the development of FragIdent, an application for the 
automatic identification of open reading frames (ORFs) within cDNA-fragments. 
The software performs BLAST analyses to identify the genes represented by the 
sequences and suggests primers to complete the sequencing of the whole insert. 
Gene-specific information as well as the protein domains encoded by the cDNA 
fragment are retrieved from Internet-based databases and included in the output. 
The application features an intuitive graphical interface and is designed for 
researchers without any bioinformatics skills. It is suited for projects 
comprising up to several hundred different clones.
CONCLUSION: We used FragIdent to identify 84 cDNA clones from a yeast two-hybrid 
experiment. Furthermore, we identified 131 protein domains within our analysed 
clones. The source code is freely available from our homepage at

Numerous new disease-gene associations have been identified by whole-exome 
sequencing studies in the last few years. However, many cases remain unsolved 
due to the sheer number of candidate variants remaining after common filtering 
strategies such as removing low quality and common variants and those deemed 
unlikely to be pathogenic. The observation that each of our genomes contains 
about 100 genuine loss-of-function variants makes identification of the 
causative mutation problematic when using these strategies alone. We propose 
using the wealth of genotype to phenotype data that already exists from model 
organism studies to assess the potential impact of these exome variants. Here, 
we introduce PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in Exomes (PHIVE), an 
algorithm that integrates the calculation of phenotype similarity between human 
diseases and genetically modified mouse models with evaluation of the variants 
according to allele frequency, pathogenicity, and mode of inheritance approaches 
in our Exomiser tool. Large-scale validation of PHIVE analysis using 100,000 
exomes containing known mutations demonstrated a substantial improvement (up to 
54.1-fold) over purely variant-based (frequency and pathogenicity) methods with 
the correct gene recalled as the top hit in up to 83% of samples, corresponding 
to an area under the ROC curve of >95%. We conclude that incorporation of 
phenotype data can play a vital role in translational bioinformatics and propose 
that exome sequencing projects should systematically capture clinical phenotypes 
to take advantage of the strategy presented here.

BACKGROUND: Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are essential for functioning 
of biological membranes. ELOVL fatty acid elongase 1 catalyses elongation of 
saturated and monounsaturated C22-C26-VLCFAs. We studied two patients with a 
dominant ELOVL1 mutation. Independently, Kutkowska-Kaźmierczak et al. had 
investigated the same patients and found the same mutation. We extended our 
study towards additional biochemical, functional, and therapeutic aspects.
METHODS: We did mutation screening by whole exome sequencing. RNA-sequencing was 
performed in patient and control fibroblasts. Ceramide and sphingomyelin levels 
were measured by LC-MS/MS. ELOVL1 activity was determined by a stable 
isotope-labelled [13C]malonyl-CoA elongation assay. ELOVL1 expression patterns 
were investigated by immunofluorescence, in situ hybridisation and RT-qPCR. As 
treatment option, we investigated VLCFA loading of fibroblasts.
RESULTS: Both patients carried an identical heterozygous de novo ELOVL1 mutation 
(c.494C>T, NM_001256399; p.S165F) not deriving from a founder allele. Patients 
suffered from epidermal hyperproliferation and increased keratinisation 
(ichthyosis). Hypomyelination of the central white matter explained spastic 
paraplegia and central nystagmus, while optic atrophy was causative for 
reduction of peripheral vision and visual acuity. The mutation abrogated ELOVL1 
enzymatic activity and reduced ≥C24 ceramides and sphingomyelins in patient 
cells. Fibroblast loading with C22:0-VLCFAs increased C24:0-ceramides and 
sphingomyelins. We found competitive inhibition for ceramide and sphingomyelin 
synthesis between saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs. Transcriptome analysis 
revealed upregulation of modules involved in epidermal development and 
keratinisation, and downregulation of genes for neurodevelopment, myelination, 
and synaptogenesis. Many regulated genes carried consensus 
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α and PPARγ binding motifs in their 
5'-regions.
CONCLUSION: A dominant ELOVL1 mutation causes a neuro-ichthyotic disorder 
possibly amenable to treatment with PPAR-modulating drugs.

Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, facial abnormalities, abnormal 
truncal fat distribution, myopia, and pigmentary retinopathy. It is often 
considered an underdiagnosed condition, especially in children with 
developmental delay and intellectual disability. Here we report on four 
individuals from a large Jordanian family clinically diagnosed with CS. Using 
Trio Exome Sequencing (Trio-WES) and MLPA analyses we identified a maternally 
inherited novel intronic nucleotide substitution c.3446-23T>G leading to the 
activation of a cryptic splice site and a paternally inherited multi-exon 
deletion in VPS13B (previously termed COH1) in the index patient. Expression 
analysis showed a strong decrease of VPS13B mRNA levels and direct sequencing of 
cDNA confirmed splicing at a cryptic upstream splice acceptor site, resulting in 
the inclusion of 22 intronic bases. This extension results in a frameshift and a 
premature stop of translation (p.Gly1149Valfs*9). Segregation analysis revealed 
that three affected maternal cousins were homozygous for the intronic splice 
site variant. Our data show causality of both alterations and strongly suggest 
the expansion of the diagnostic strategy to search for intronic splice variants 
in molecularly unconfirmed patients affected by CS.

There are many thousands of hereditary diseases in humans, each of which has a 
specific combination of phenotypic features, but computational analysis of 
phenotypic data has been hampered by lack of adequate computational data 
structures. Therefore, we have developed a Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) with 
over 8000 terms representing individual phenotypic anomalies and have annotated 
all clinical entries in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man with the terms of 
the HPO. We show that the HPO is able to capture phenotypic similarities between 
diseases in a useful and highly significant fashion.

Nephronophthisis (NPHP), an autosomal recessive kidney disease, is the most 
frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in the first three decades of 
life. Positional cloning of the six known NPHP genes has linked its pathogenesis 
to primary cilia function. Here we identify mutation of GLIS2 as causing an 
NPHP-like phenotype in humans and mice, using positional cloning and mouse 
transgenics, respectively. Kidneys of Glis2 mutant mice show severe renal 
atrophy and fibrosis starting at 8 weeks of age. Differential gene expression 
studies on Glis2 mutant kidneys demonstrate that genes promoting 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis are upregulated in the absence 
of Glis2. Thus, we identify Glis2 as a transcription factor mutated in NPHP and 
demonstrate its essential role for the maintenance of renal tissue architecture 
through prevention of apoptosis and fibrosis.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are gaining importance in the 
routine clinical diagnostic setting. It is thus desirable to simplify the 
workflow for high-throughput diagnostics. Fragmentation of DNA is a crucial step 
for preparation of template libraries and various methods are currently known. 
Here we evaluated the performance of nebulization, sonication and random 
enzymatic digestion of long-range PCR products on the results of NGS. All three 
methods produced high-quality sequencing libraries for the 454 platform. 
However, if long-range PCR products of different length were pooled equimolarly, 
sequence coverage drastically dropped for fragments below 3,000 bp. All three 
methods performed equally well with regard to overall sequence quality (PHRED) 
and read length. Enzymatic fragmentation showed highest consistency between 
three library preparations but performed slightly worse than sonication and 
nebulization with regard to insertions/deletions in the raw sequence reads. 
After filtering for homopolymer errors, enzymatic fragmentation performed best 
if compared to the results of classic Sanger sequencing. As the overall 
performance of all three methods was equal with only minor differences, a 
fragmentation method can be chosen solely according to lab facilities, 
feasibility and experimental design.

Hospital Berlin (A.v.M.), Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the underlying genetic cause of a congenital neuropathy 
in a 5-year-old boy as part of a cohort of 32 patients from 23 families with 
genetically unresolved neuropathies.
METHODS: We used autozygosity mapping coupled with next-generation sequencing to 
investigate a consanguineous family from Lebanon with 1 affected and 2 healthy 
children. Variants were investigated for segregation in the family by Sanger 
sequencing. A splice site mutation was further evaluated on the messenger RNA 
level by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Subsequently, a larger cohort 
was specifically screened for receptor expression-enhancing protein 1 (REEP1) 
gene mutations.
RESULTS: We detected a homozygous splice donor mutation in REEP1 
(c.303+1-7GTAATAT>AC, p.F62Kfs23*; NM_022912) that cosegregated with the 
phenotype in the family, leading to complete skipping of exon 4 and a premature 
stop codon. The phenotype of the patient is similar to spinal muscular atrophy 
with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) with additional distal arthrogryposis 
and involvement of the upper motor neuron manifested by pronounced 
hyperreflexia.
CONCLUSION: To date, only dominant REEP1 mutations have been reported to be 
associated with a slowly progressive hereditary spastic paraplegia. The findings 
from our patient expand the phenotypical spectrum and the mode of inheritance of 
REEP1-associated disorders. Recessive mutations in REEP1 should be considered in 
the molecular genetic workup of patients with a neuromuscular disorder 
resembling SMARD1, especially if additional signs of upper motor neuron 
involvement and distal arthrogryposis are present.

The identification of recessive disease-causing genes by homozygosity mapping is 
often restricted by lack of suitable consanguineous families. To overcome these 
limitations, we apply homozygosity mapping to single affected individuals from 
outbred populations. In 72 individuals of 54 kindred ascertained worldwide with 
known homozygous mutations in 13 different recessive disease genes, we performed 
total genome homozygosity mapping using 250,000 SNP arrays. Likelihood ratio 
Z-scores (ZLR) were plotted across the genome to detect ZLR peaks that reflect 
segments of homozygosity by descent, which may harbor the mutated gene. In 93% 
of cases, the causative gene was positioned within a consistent ZLR peak of 
homozygosity. The number of peaks reflected the degree of inbreeding. We 
demonstrate that disease-causing homozygous mutations can be detected in single 
cases from outbred populations within a single ZLR peak of homozygosity as short 
as 2 Mb, containing an average of only 16 candidate genes. As many specialty 
clinics have access to cohorts of individuals from outbred populations, and as 
our approach will result in smaller genetic candidate regions, the new strategy 
of homozygosity mapping in single outbred individuals will strongly accelerate 
the discovery of novel recessive disease genes.

Impaired fetal movement causes malformations, summarized as fetal akinesia 
deformation sequence (FADS), and is triggered by environmental and genetic 
factors. Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) components are suspects because mutations 
in the fetally expressed gamma subunit (CHRNG) of AChR were found in two FADS 
disorders, lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS) and Escobar syndrome. Other 
AChR subunits alpha1, beta1, and delta (CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND) as well as 
receptor-associated protein of the synapse (RAPSN) previously revealed missense 
or compound nonsense-missense mutations in viable congenital myasthenic 
syndrome; lethality of homozygous null mutations was predicted but never shown. 
We provide the first report to our knowledge of homozygous nonsense mutations in 
CHRNA1 and CHRND and show that they were lethal, whereas novel recessive 
missense mutations in RAPSN caused a severe but not necessarily lethal 
phenotype. To elucidate disease-associated malformations such as frequent 
abortions, fetal edema, cystic hygroma, or cardiac defects, we studied Chrna1, 
Chrnb1, Chrnd, Chrng, and Rapsn in mouse embryos and found expression in 
skeletal muscles but also in early somite development. This indicates that early 
developmental defects might be due to somite expression in addition to solely 
muscle-specific effects. We conclude that complete or severe functional 
disruption of fetal AChR causes lethal multiple pterygium syndrome whereas 
milder alterations result in fetal hypokinesia with inborn contractures or a 
myasthenic syndrome later in life.

The autosomal recessive kidney disease nephronophthisis (NPHP) constitutes the 
most frequent genetic cause of terminal renal failure in the first 3 decades of 
life. Ten causative genes (NPHP1-NPHP9 and NPHP11), whose products localize to 
the primary cilia-centrosome complex, support the unifying concept that cystic 
kidney diseases are "ciliopathies". Using genome-wide homozygosity mapping, we 
report here what we believe to be a new locus (NPHP-like 1 [NPHPL1]) for an 
NPHP-like nephropathy. In 2 families with an NPHP-like phenotype, we detected 
homozygous frameshift and splice-site mutations, respectively, in the X-prolyl 
aminopeptidase 3 (XPNPEP3) gene. In contrast to all known NPHP proteins, XPNPEP3 
localizes to mitochondria of renal cells. However, in vivo analyses also 
revealed a likely cilia-related function; suppression of zebrafish xpnpep3 
phenocopied the developmental phenotypes of ciliopathy morphants, and this 
effect was rescued by human XPNPEP3 that was devoid of a mitochondrial 
localization signal. Consistent with a role for XPNPEP3 in ciliary function, 
several ciliary cystogenic proteins were found to be XPNPEP3 substrates, for 
which resistance to N-terminal proline cleavage resulted in attenuated protein 
function in vivo in zebrafish. Our data highlight an emerging link between 
mitochondria and ciliary dysfunction, and suggest that further understanding the 
enzymatic activity and substrates of XPNPEP3 will illuminate novel cystogenic 
pathways.

Nephrotic syndrome, a malfunction of the kidney glomerular filter, leads to 
proteinuria, edema and, in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, end-stage 
kidney disease. Using positional cloning, we identified mutations in the 
phospholipase C epsilon gene (PLCE1) as causing early-onset nephrotic syndrome 
with end-stage kidney disease. Kidney histology of affected individuals showed 
diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). Using immunofluorescence, we found 
PLCepsilon1 expression in developing and mature glomerular podocytes and showed 
that DMS represents an arrest of normal glomerular development. We identified IQ 
motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 as a new interaction partner of 
PLCepsilon1. Two siblings with a missense mutation in an exon encoding the 
PLCepsilon1 catalytic domain showed histology characteristic of focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis. Notably, two other affected individuals responded to 
therapy, making this the first report of a molecular cause of nephrotic syndrome 
that may resolve after therapy. These findings, together with the zebrafish 
model of human nephrotic syndrome generated by plce1 knockdown, open new inroads 
into pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms of nephrotic syndrome.

Proteoglycans are a major component of extracellular matrix and contribute to 
normal embryonic and postnatal development by ensuring tissue stability and 
signaling functions. We studied five patients with recessive joint dislocations 
and congenital heart defects, including bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and aortic 
root dilatation. We identified linkage to chromosome 11 and detected a mutation 
(c.830G>A, p.Arg277Gln) in B3GAT3, the gene coding for glucuronosyltransferase-I 
(GlcAT-I). The enzyme catalyzes an initial step in the synthesis of 
glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans. Patients' cells as well as 
recombinant mutant protein showed reduced glucuronyltransferase activity. 
Patient fibroblasts demonstrated decreased levels of dermatan sulfate, 
chondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, indicating that the 
defect in linker synthesis affected all three lines of O-glycanated 
proteoglycans. Further studies demonstrated that GlcAT-I resides in the cis and 
cis-medial Golgi apparatus and is expressed in the affected tissues, i.e., 
heart, aorta, and bone. The study shows that reduced GlcAT-I activity impairs 
skeletal as well as heart development and results in variable combinations of 
heart malformations, including mitral valve prolapse, ventricular septal defect, 
and bicuspid aortic valve. The described family constitutes a syndrome 
characterized by heart defects and joint dislocations resulting from altered 
initiation of proteoglycan synthesis (Larsen-like syndrome, B3GAT3 type).

BACKGROUND: We present the first genome-wide cDNA array analysis of human 
congenitally malformed hearts and attempted to partially elucidate these complex 
phenotypes. Most congenital heart defects, which account for the largest number 
of birth defects in humans, represent complex genetic disorders. As a 
consequence of the malformation, abnormal hemodynamic features occur and cause 
an adaptation process of the heart.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The statistical analysis of our data suggests distinct gene 
expression profiles associated with tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal 
defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Applying correspondence analysis, we 
could associate specific gene functions to specific phenotypes. Furthermore, our 
study design allows the suggestion that alterations associated with primary 
genetic abnormalities can be distinguished from those associated with the 
adaptive response of the heart to the malformation (right ventricular pressure 
overload hypertrophy). We provide evidence for the molecular transition of the 
hypertrophic right ventricle to normal left ventricular characteristics. 
Furthermore, we present data on chamber-specific gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings propose that array analysis of malformed human hearts 
opens a new window to understand the complex genetic network of cardiac 
development and adaptation. For detailed access, see the online-only Data 
Supplement.

Carpenter syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder with autosomal recessive 
inheritance, the cardinal features of which include craniosynostosis, 
polysyndactyly, obesity, and cardiac defects. Using homozygosity mapping, we 
found linkage to chromosome 6p12.1-q12 and, in 15 independent families, 
identified five different mutations (four truncating and one missense) in RAB23, 
which encodes a member of the RAB guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) family of 
vesicle transport proteins and acts as a negative regulator of hedgehog (HH) 
signaling. In 10 patients, the disease was caused by homozygosity for the same 
nonsense mutation, L145X, that resides on a common haplotype, indicative of a 
founder effect in patients of northern European descent. Surprisingly, nonsense 
mutations of Rab23 in open brain mice cause recessive embryonic lethality with 
neural-tube defects, suggesting a species difference in the requirement for 
RAB23 during early development. The discovery of RAB23 mutations in patients 
with Carpenter syndrome implicates HH signaling in cranial-suture biogenesis--an 
unexpected finding, given that craniosynostosis is not usually associated with 
mutations of other HH-pathway components--and provides a new molecular target 
for studies of obesity.

OBJECTIVES: Many genetic disorders are caused by copy number variations (CNVs) 
in the human genome. However, the large number of benign CNV polymorphisms makes 
it difficult to delineate causative variants for a certain disease phenotype. 
Hence, we set out to create software that accumulates and visualises 
locus-specific knowledge and enables clinicians to study their own CNVs in the 
context of known polymorphisms and disease variants.
METHODS: CNV data from healthy cohorts (Database of Genomic Variants) and from 
disease-related databases (DECIPHER) were integrated into a joint resource. Data 
are presented in an interactive web-based application that allows inspection, 
evaluation and filtering of CNVs in single individuals or in entire cohorts.
RESULTS: CNVinspector provides simple interfaces to upload CNV data, compare 
them with own or published control data and visualise the results in graphical 
interfaces. Beyond choosing control data from different public studies, 
platforms and methods, dedicated filter options allow the detection of CNVs that 
are either enriched in patients or depleted in controls. Alternatively, a search 
can be restricted to those CNVs that appear in individuals of similar clinical 
phenotype. For each gene of interest within a CNV, we provide a link to NCBI, 
ENSEMBL and the GeneDistiller search engine to browse for potential 
disease-associated genes.
CONCLUSIONS: With its user-friendly handling, the integration of control data 
and the filtering options, CNVinspector will facilitate the daily work of 
clinical geneticists and accelerate the delineation of new syndromes and gene 
functions. CNVinspector is freely accessible under http://www.cnvinspector.org.

phenotype.

Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity-leptodactylic type (SEMDJL2) 
is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia which is characterized by midface 
hypoplasia, short stature, joint laxity with dislocations, genua valga, 
progressive scoliosis, and slender fingers. Recently, heterozygous missense 
mutations in KIF22, a gene which encodes a member of the kinesin-like protein 
family, have been identified in sporadic as well as familial cases of SEMDJL2. 
In the present study homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing were 
combined to analyze a consanguineous family with a phenotype resembling SEMDJL2. 
We identified homozygous missense mutations in the two nearby genes NIN (Ninein) 
and POLE2 (DNA polymerase epsilon subunit B) which segregate with the disease in 
the family and were not present in 500 healthy control individuals and in the 
1094 control individuals contained within the 1000-genomes database. We present 
several lines of evidence that mutant Ninein is most likely causative for the 
SEMDJL2-like phenotype. The centrosomal protein NIN shows a functional 
relationship with KIF22 and other proteins associated with chromosome 
congression/movement, centrosomal function, and ciliogenesis, which have been 
associated with skeletal dysplasias. Moreover, compound heterozygous missense 
mutations at more N-terminal positions of Ninein have very recently been 
identified in a family with microcephalic primordial dwarfism. Together with the 
present report this strongly supports a fundamental role of Ninein in skeletal 
development.

GrabBlur--a framework to facilitate the secure exchange of whole-exome and 
-genome SNV data using VCF files.

Stade B, Seelow D, Thomsen I, Krawczak M, Franke A.

BACKGROUND: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of whole exomes or genomes is 
increasingly being used in human genetic research and diagnostics. Sharing NGS 
data with third parties can help physicians and researchers to identify 
causative or predisposing mutations for a specific sample of interest more 
efficiently. In many cases, however, the exchange of such data may collide with 
data privacy regulations. GrabBlur is a newly developed tool to aggregate and 
share NGS-derived single nucleotide variant (SNV) data in a public database, 
keeping individual samples unidentifiable. In contrast to other currently 
existing SNV databases, GrabBlur includes phenotypic information and contact 
details of the submitter of a given database entry. By means of GrabBlur human 
geneticists can securely and easily share SNV data from resequencing projects. 
GrabBlur can ease the interpretation of SNV data by offering basic annotations, 
genotype frequencies and in particular phenotypic information - given that this 
information was shared - for the SNV of interest.
TOOL DESCRIPTION: GrabBlur facilitates the combination of phenotypic and NGS 
data (VCF files) via a local interface or command line operations. Data 
submissions may include HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms, other trait 
descriptions, NGS technology information and the identity of the submitter. Most 
of this information is optional and its provision at the discretion of the 
submitter. Upon initial intake, GrabBlur merges and aggregates all 
sample-specific data. If a certain SNV is rare, the sample-specific information 
is replaced with the submitter identity. Generally, all data in GrabBlur are 
highly aggregated so that they can be shared with others while ensuring maximum 
privacy. Thus, it is impossible to reconstruct complete exomes or genomes from 
the database or to re-identify single individuals. After the individual 
information has been sufficiently "blurred", the data can be uploaded into a 
publicly accessible domain where aggregated genotypes are provided alongside 
phenotypic information. A web interface allows querying the database and the 
extraction of gene-wise SNV information. If an interesting SNV is found, the 
interrogator can get in contact with the submitter to exchange further 
information on the carrier and clarify, for example, whether the latter's 
phenotype matches with phenotype of their own patient.

Claudins are major components of tight junctions and contribute to the 
epithelial-barrier function by restricting free diffusion of solutes through the 
paracellular pathway. We have mapped a new locus for recessive renal magnesium 
loss on chromosome 1p34.2 and have identified mutations in CLDN19, a member of 
the claudin multigene family, in patients affected by hypomagnesemia, renal 
failure, and severe ocular abnormalities. CLDN19 encodes the tight-junction 
protein claudin-19, and we demonstrate high expression of CLDN19 in renal 
tubules and the retina. The identified mutations interfere severely with either 
cell-membrane trafficking or the assembly of the claudin-19 protein. The 
identification of CLDN19 mutations in patients with chronic renal failure and 
severe visual impairment supports the fundamental role of claudin-19 for normal 
renal tubular function and undisturbed organization and development of the 
retina.

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is caused by heterogeneous pathologies 
leading to multiple antenatal joint contractures through fetal akinesia. 
Understanding the pathophysiology of this disorder is important for clinical 
care of the affected individuals and genetic counseling of the families. We thus 
aimed to establish the genetic basis of an AMC subtype that is associated with 
multiple dysmorphic features and intellectual disability (ID). We used haplotype 
analysis, next-generation sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization, 
and chromosome breakpoint mapping to identify the pathogenic mutations in 
families and simplex cases. Suspected disease variants were verified by 
cosegregation analysis. We identified disease-causing mutations in the 
zinc-finger gene ZC4H2 in four families affected by X-linked AMC plus ID and one 
family affected by cerebral palsy. Several heterozygous females were also 
affected, but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we found two ZC4H2 deletions and 
one rearrangement in two female and one male unrelated simplex cases, 
respectively. In mouse primary hippocampal neurons, transiently produced ZC4H2 
localized to the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses, and the 
altered protein influenced dendritic spine density. In zebrafish, 
antisense-morpholino-mediated zc4h2 knockdown caused abnormal swimming and 
impaired α-motoneuron development. All missense mutations identified herein 
failed to rescue the swimming defect of zebrafish morphants. We conclude that 
ZC4H2 point mutations, rearrangements, and small deletions cause a clinically 
variable broad-spectrum neurodevelopmental disorder of the central and 
peripheral nervous systems in both familial and simplex cases of both sexes. Our 
results highlight the importance of ZC4H2 for genetic testing of individuals 
presenting with ID plus muscle weakness and minor or major forms of AMC.

We earlier reported significant evidence for linkage on chromosome 15q15 in 
periodic catatonia, a sub-phenotype of schizophrenic psychoses. The disorder is 
characterized by qualitative hyperkinetic and akinetic psychomotor disturbances 
through acute psychotic episodes and debilitating symptoms in the long term, 
with psychomotor weakness, grimacing facial movements and apathy. Here, we 
confirm mapping of a major gene locus on chromosome 15q15 in a second genome 
scan in a new set of four multiplex families. Non-parametric multipoint linkage 
analyses identified a broad region with a maximum peak of Z(all) =3.91 ( 
P=0.006) and Z(lr) =3.04 at D15S1234 ( P=0.001), satisfying conventional 
criteria for confirmed linkage. Parametric affected-only analyses under an 
autosomal dominant model gave a maximum HLOD score of 1.65 (D15S1234) with an 
estimated 47% of families being linked. Analysis of individual families showed 
that one large family showed linkage, whereas two others could be clearly 
excluded, confirming genetic heterogeneity. No other locus reached suggestive 
levels of significance. Haplotype analysis on chromosome 15 in this and 
previously linked families placed the susceptibility region to a 11-cM interval 
between marker D15S1042 and D15S659. Periodic catatonia is the first 
sub-phenotype of schizophrenic psychoses with confirmed linkage despite the 
existence of considerable genetic heterogeneity.

Generalized progressive retinal atrophy (gPRA) belongs to a group of inherited 
retinal diseases which are associated with gradual vision loss in various dog 
breeds, including the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier (GIT). By genome-wide 
homozygosity mapping using SNP arrays and fine mapping of candidate regions, we 
assigned the gPRA candidate locus in this breed to canine chromosome 16. The 
respective region is syntenic with human chromosome 8 comprising the ADAM 
metallopeptidase domain 9 (ADAM9) gene. ADAM9 represents a strong candidate gene 
for canine retinal disease because mutations have previously been shown to cause 
autosomal recessively inherited human cone-rod dystrophy, a retinal disorder 
affecting photoreceptor function. Sequence analysis of ADAM9 in affected and 
carrier GITs revealed a deletion of exons 15 and 16 which alters the reading 
frame leading to a premature stop codon. This mutation was absent from 34 other 
dog breeds. A variable and, at times, very late onset of gPRA was confirmed in 
GITs by a relatively mild retinal degeneration at an advanced age. Hence, the 
identification of the genetic defect underlying gPRA in the GIT represents a 
suitable model for cone-rod dystrophy of humans, with superior potential to 
elucidate functional consequences of the recently described null mutations in 
the human ADAM9 gene.

Mutations in several genes cause mtDNA depletion associated with 
encephalomyopathy. Due to phenotypic overlap, it is difficult to conclude from 
clinical phenotype to genetic defect. Here we report on two brothers who 
presented with rapid fatty muscle degeneration, axonal neuropathy, rapid loss of 
supratentorial white and gray matter, and status epilepticus. Whole exome 
sequencing coupled with 'identity-by-state' (IBS) analysis revealed a compound 
heterozygous missense mutation (p.M117V, p.A139V) in the thymidine kinase 2 
(TK2) gene that segregated with the phenotype. Both mutations were located in 
the thymidine binding pouch of the enzyme. Residual mtDNA copy numbers in muscle 
were 8.5%, but normal in blood and fibroblasts. Our results broaden the clinical 
phenotype spectrum of TK2 mutations and promote WES as a useful method in the 
clinical setting for mutation detection, even in untypical cases. If two or more 
affected siblings from a non-consanguineous family can be investigated, 
IBS-analysis provides a powerful tool to narrow the number of disease 
candidates, similarly to autozygosity mapping in consanguineous families.

mutations.

We investigated eight families with a novel subtype of congenital generalized 
lipodystrophy (CGL4) of whom five members had died from sudden cardiac death 
during their teenage years. ECG studies revealed features of long-QT syndrome, 
bradycardia, as well as supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Further 
symptoms comprised myopathy with muscle rippling, skeletal as well as 
smooth-muscle hypertrophy, leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility and 
hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in some children. Additionally, we found impaired 
bone formation with osteopenia, osteoporosis, and atlanto-axial instability. 
Homozygosity mapping located the gene within 2 Mbp on chromosome 17. 
Prioritization of 74 candidate genes with GeneDistiller for high expression in 
muscle and adipocytes suggested PTRF-CAVIN (Polymerase I and transcript release 
factor/Cavin) as the most probable candidate leading to the detection of 
homozygous mutations (c.160delG, c.362dupT). PTRF-CAVIN is essential for 
caveolae biogenesis. These cholesterol-rich plasmalemmal vesicles are involved 
in signal-transduction and vesicular trafficking and reside primarily on 
adipocytes, myocytes, and osteoblasts. Absence of PTRF-CAVIN did not influence 
abundance of its binding partner caveolin-1 and caveolin-3. In patient 
fibroblasts, however, caveolin-1 failed to localize toward the cell surface and 
electron microscopy revealed reduction of caveolae to less than 3%. Transfection 
of full-length PTRF-CAVIN reestablished the presence of caveolae. The loss of 
caveolae was confirmed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in combination with 
fluorescent imaging. PTRF-CAVIN deficiency thus presents the phenotypic spectrum 
caused by a quintessential lack of functional caveolae.

BACKGROUND: Motivated by a biomedical database set up by our group, we aimed to 
develop a generic database front-end with embedded knowledge discovery and 
analysis features. A major focus was the human-oriented representation of the 
data and the enabling of a closed circle of data query, exploration, 
visualization and analysis.
RESULTS: We introduce a non-task-specific database front-end with a new 
visualization strategy and built-in analysis features, so called d-matrix. 
d-matrix is web-based and compatible with a broad range of database management 
systems. The graphical outcome consists of boxes whose colors show the quality 
of the underlying information and, as the name suggests, they are arranged in 
matrices. The granularity of the data display allows consequent drill-down. 
Furthermore, d-matrix offers context-sensitive categorization, hierarchical 
sorting and statistical analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: d-matrix enables data mining, with a high level of interactivity 
between humans and computer as a primary factor. We believe that the presented 
strategy can be very effective in general and especially useful for the 
integration of distinct data types such as phenotypical and molecular data.
