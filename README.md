# wViP
wViP (http://wvip.biocuckoo.cn/) is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.

  We provide an easy-to-use web server called word cloud visualization of biological profiles (wViP), which transforms literature into a concise and intuitive word cloud based on natural language processing results. Multiple options are provided in wViP, and word clouds can be recolored, rescaled or reshaped in a customized manner. In addition, to further expands the application scenarios, enrichment analysis, as one of the most frequently conducted methods, was introduced to wViP. For optimizing the visualization of enrichment analysis results, wViP provided two intuitive and commonly used presentation strategies, funnel plot and treemap. wViP provided analysis results and publication-quality figures can be exported in a user-friendly manner. We propose that wViP represents a useful word cloud-centered illustrator for the visualization of biological profiles. wViP will be continuously maintained and improved upon users' comments and feedbacks.

  The test data and scripts for this project are fully public.
